Even if the pot is broken, the
ether that is within and without it cannot be destroyed. Similarly, if the bodies and all other objects
perish, the eternal Self that pervades them cannot be destroyed; It is the living Truth.
Antavanta ime dehaa nityasyoktaah shareerinah;
Anaashino’prameyasya tasmaad yudhyaswa bhaarata.
18. These bodies of the embodied Self, which is eternal, indestructible and immeasurable,
are said to have an end. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna!
Ya enam vetti hantaaram yashchainam manyate hatam;
Ubhau tau na vijaaneeto naayam hanti na hanyate.
19. He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks He is slain, neither of them
knows; He slays not nor is He slain.
Na jaayate mriyate vaa kadaachin
Naayam bhootwaa bhavitaa vaa na bhooyah;
Ajo nityah shaashwato’yam puraano

Na hanyate hanyamaane shareere.
