The Lord gave Arjuna the divine eye of intuition. He can do anything. His
Grace can make the dumb man eloquent and the cripple a climber of mountains.
Solutions to Conflicting Verses
A critic says: “In the Gita, III.33, it is said, ‘Even a wise man acts in accordance with his
own nature; beings follow their nature; what can restraint do?’ What then is the use of our attempt at
controlling the senses and the mind when our nature is so powerful and overwhelming? How can
our Sadhana overcome it?”
In the very next verse, Lord Krishna distinctly advises us to control likes and dislikes. Our
nature can be subdued by Sadhana. When studying the Gita you should not confine the meaning to
one verse exclusively, but see its connection with the previous and succeeding verses of the same
discourse as well as of all the other discourses.
