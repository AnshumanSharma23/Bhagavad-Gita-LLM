The seven great sages, the ancient four and also the Manus, possessed of powers like Me
(on account of their minds being fixed on Me), were born of (My) mind; from them are these
creatures born in this world.
Etaam vibhootim yogam cha mama yo vetti tattwatah;
Soâ€™vikampena yogena yujyate naatra samshayah.

THE YOGA OF THE DIVINE GLORIES
7. He who in truth knows these manifold manifestations of My Being and (this)
Yoga-power of Mine, becomes established in the unshakeable Yoga; there is no doubt about it.
Aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate;
Iti matwaa bhajante maam budhaa bhaavasamanvitaah.
8. I am the source of all; from Me everything evolves; understanding thus, the wise,
endowed with meditation, worship Me.
Macchittaa madgatapraanaa bodhayantah parasparam;
Kathayantashcha maam nityam tushyanti cha ramanti cha.
