I desire to know severally, O mighty-armed, the essence or truth of renunciation, O
Hrishikesa, as also of abandonment, O slayer of Kesi!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Kaamyaanaam karmanaam nyaasam sannyaasam kavayoviduh;
Sarvakarmaphalatyaagam praahustyaagam vichakshanaah.
The Blessed Lord said:
2. The sages understand Sannyas to be the renunciation of action with desire; the wise
declare the abandonment of the fruits of all actions as Tyaga.
Tyaajyam doshavadityeke karma praahurmaneeshinah;
Yajnadaanatapah karma na tyaajyamiti chaapare.
3. Some philosophers declare that all actions should be abandoned as an evil, while others
declare that acts of gift, sacrifice and austerity should not be relinquished.
Nishchayam shrinu me tatra tyaage bharatasattama;
Tyaago hi purushavyaaghra trividhah samprakeertitah.
