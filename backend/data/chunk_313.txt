Lord Krishna brings out quite clearly and unmistakably here the intimate connection between
ethics and spirituality, between a life of virtue and God-realisation and liberation. Listing two sets
of qualities of opposite kinds, the Lord classifies them as divine and demoniacal (undivine), and
urges us to eradicate the latter and cultivate the divine qualities.
What kind of nature should one develop? What conduct must one follow? What way should
one live and act if one must attain God and obtain divine bliss? These questions are answered with
perfect clarity and very definitely. The pure divine qualities are conducive to peace and liberation
and the undivine qualities lead to bondage.
