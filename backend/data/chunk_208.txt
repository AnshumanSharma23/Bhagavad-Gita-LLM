But verily there exists, higher than the unmanifested, another unmanifested Eternal who
is not destroyed when all beings are destroyed.
COMMENTARY: Another unmanifested Eternal refers to Para Brahman, which is
distinct from the unmanifested (primordial Nature), and which is of quite a different nature. It is
superior to Hiranyagarbha (the creative Intelligence) and the unmanifested Nature because It is
their cause. It is not destroyed when all beings from Brahma down to a blade of grass are destroyed.
