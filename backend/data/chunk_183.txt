By that very former practice he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely

COMMENTARY: One who had fallen from Yoga is carried to the goal (which he intended
to reach in his previous birth), by the force of the impressions of his past Yogic practices, though he
may be unconscious of it and may not be willing to adopt the course of Yogic discipline due to the
force of some evil Karma.
Prayatnaadyatamaanastu yogee samshuddhakilbishah;
Anekajanmasamsiddhas tato yaati paraam gatim.
45. But, the Yogi who strives with assiduity, purified of sins and perfected gradually
through many births, reaches the highest goal.
Tapaswibhyo’dhiko yogee jnaanibhyo’pi mato’dhikah;
Karmibhyashchaadhiko yogee tasmaad yogee bhavaarjuna.
