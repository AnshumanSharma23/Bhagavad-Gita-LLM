Having spoken thus to Hrishikesa (Lord of the senses), Arjuna (the conqueror of sleep),
the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna: “I will not fight,” and became silent.
Tam uvaacha hrisheekeshah prahasanniva bhaarata;
Senayor ubhayor madhye visheedantam idam vachah.
10. To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Sri Krishna, as if smiling, O
Bharata, spoke these words!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Ashochyaan anvashochastwam prajnaavaadaamshcha bhaashase;
Gataasoon agataasoomshcha naanushochanti panditaah.
The Blessed Lord said:
11. Thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of
wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.
Na twevaaham jaatu naasam na twam neme janaadhipaah;
Na chaiva na bhavishyaamah sarve vayam atah param.
12.
