Abandoning all duties, take refuge in Me alone; I will liberate thee from all sins; grieve
not.
Idam te naatapaskaaya naabhaktaaya kadaachana;
Na chaashushrooshave vaachyam na cha maam yoâ€™bhyasooyati.
67. This is never to be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerities, to one who is not
devoted, nor to one who does not render service, nor who does not desire to listen, nor to one who
cavils at Me.
Ya imam paramam guhyam madbhakteshvabhidhaasyati;
Bhaktim mayi paraam kritwaa maamevaishyatyasamshayah.
68. He who with supreme devotion to Me will teach this supreme secret to My devotees,
shall doubtless come to Me.
Na cha tasmaanmanushyeshu kashchinme priyakrittamah;
Bhavitaa na cha me tasmaadanyah priyataro bhuvi.
69. Nor is there any among men who does dearer service to Me, nor shall there be another on
earth dearer to Me than he.
