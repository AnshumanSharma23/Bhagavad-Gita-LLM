It is meet, O Krishna, that the world delights and rejoices in Thy praise; demons fly in
fear to all quarters and the hosts of the perfected ones bow to Thee!
Kasmaachcha te na nameran mahaatman
Gareeyase brahmanoâ€™pyaadikartre;
Ananta devesha jagannivaasa
Twamaksharam sadasattatparam yat.
37. And why should they not, O great soul, bow to Thee who art greater (than all else), the
primal cause even of (Brahma) the creator, O Infinite Being! O Lord of the gods! O abode of the
universe! Thou art the imperishable, the Being, the non-being and That which is the supreme (that
which is beyond the Being and non-being).
COMMENTARY: The Lord is Mahatma. He is greater than all else. He is the
imperishable, so He is the proper object of worship, love and delight.
Twamaadidevah purushah puraanas
Twamasya vishwasya param nidhaanam;
Vettaasi vedyam cha param cha dhaama
Twayaa tatam vishwamanantaroopa.
