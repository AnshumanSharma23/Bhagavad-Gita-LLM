PRAYER TO VYASA
Namostu te vyaasa visaalabuddhe
phullaaravindaa yatapatranetra,
Yena twayaa bhaaratatailapoornah
prajwaalito jnaanamayah pradeepah.
Salutations unto thee, O Vyasa, of broad intellect and with eyes large like the petals of a
full-blown lotus, by whom the lamp of divine knowledge, filled with the oil of the Mahabharata,
has been lighted!
PRAYER TO THE GURU
Gururbrahmaa gururvishnurgururdevo maheshwarah;
Guruh saakshaat param brahma tasmai shree gurave namah.
Guru is the creator (Brahma); Guru is the preserver (Vishnu); Guru is the destroyer
(Maheshvara); Guru is verily the Supreme Absolute.
