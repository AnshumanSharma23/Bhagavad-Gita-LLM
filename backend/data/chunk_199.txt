This is the secret of invoking His
Grace and attaining Him and becoming eternally free and blissful.
Arjuna here asks Lord Krishna about the meaning of the different terms referred to by Him
in the last two verses of the previous chapter. He wishes to know what is the Supreme Being, what is
Karma or action that He refers to, and what is the meaning that pertains to this spirit, the elements
and the centre of all things within this human body.

BHAGAVAD GITA
Beyond all things manifest and unmanifest, beyond these names and forms, there is the
Supreme Being—Brahman. He indwells this body as the centre of all things, including even our
own self (individual soul). We are a spiritual being residing in this body and supported by the Silent
Witness within—the Supreme Antaryamin. Prakriti or Nature is the being pertaining to the
elements.
