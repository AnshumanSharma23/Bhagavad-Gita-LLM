A doubt therefore arises in Arjunaâ€™s mind as to the necessity of engaging
in action even after one has attained this state.
Sri Krishna clears this doubt by telling him that although one has realised oneness with the
Eternal, one has to perform action through the force of Prakriti or Nature. He emphasises that
perfection is attained not by ceasing to engage in action but by doing all actions as a divine offering,
imbued with a spirit of non-attachment and sacrifice.
The man of God-vision, Sri Krishna explains to Arjuna, need not engage in action, as he has
attained everything that has to be attained. He can be ever absorbed in the calm and immutable Self.
But to perform action for the good of the world and for the education of the masses is no doubt
superior. Therefore, action is necessary not only for one who has attained perfection but also for one
who is striving for perfection.
