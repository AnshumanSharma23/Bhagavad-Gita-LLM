Salutations to Lord Krishna, the Parijata or the Kalpataru or the bestower of all desires for
those who take refuge in Him, the holder of the whip in one hand, the holder of the symbol of divine
knowledge and the milker of the divine nectar of the Bhagavad Gita!
Sarvopanishado gaavo dogdhaa gopaalanandanah;
Paartho vatsah sudheer bhoktaa dugdham geetaamritam mahat.
4. All the Upanishads are the cows; the milker is Krishna; the cowherd boy, Partha
(Arjuna), is the calf; men of purified intellect are the drinkers; the milk is the great nectar of the
Gita.
Vasudevasutam devam kamsachaanooramardanam;
Devakeeparamaanandam krishnam vande jagadgurum.
