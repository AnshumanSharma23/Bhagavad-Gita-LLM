In front of Bhishma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth, said: “O Arjuna, behold
now all these Kurus gathered together!”
Tatraapashyat sthitaan paarthah pitrin atha pitaamahaan;
Aachaaryaan maatulaan bhraatrun putraan pautraan sakheemstathaa.
26. Then Arjuna beheld there stationed, grandfathers and fathers, teachers, maternal uncles,
brothers, sons, grandsons and friends, too.
Shvashuraan suhridashchaiva senayorubhayorapi;
Taan sameekshya sa kaunteyah sarvaan bandhoon avasthitaan.
Kripayaa parayaa’vishto visheedannidam abraveet;
27.
(He
saw)
fathers-in-law
and
friends
also
in
both
armies.
The
son
of
Kunti—Arjuna—seeing all these kinsmen standing arrayed, spoke thus sorrowfully, filled with
deep pity.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Drishtwemam swajanam krishna yuyutsum samupasthitam.
Arjuna said:
28. Seeing these, my kinsmen, O Krishna, arrayed, eager to fight,
Seedanti mama gaatraani mukham cha parishushyati;
Vepathushcha shareere me romaharshashcha jaayate.
