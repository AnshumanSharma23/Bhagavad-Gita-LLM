True life is
identification with this Supreme Soul, which exists in the past, present and future, which has neither
a beginning, middle nor end, which has neither parts nor limbs, which is neither subtle nor gross.
The sages of ancient times attained this mysterious and most marvellous state through the
eye of intuition or the divine third eye. They then explained the things of this world in the light of
their intuitive knowledge of the Self. This is the direct method of Self-realisation.
You can ascend the summit of the hill of knowledge through science, art, Nature, music, etc.
This is the indirect method. From the effect you go to the cause and ultimately reach the causeless
Cause or Para Brahman, the Truth which is transcendental. Our Western scientists will grope in
utter darkness if their purpose is only to invent some things for our physical convenience.
