The space between the earth and the heaven and all the quarters are filled by Thee alone;
having seen this, Thy wonderful and terrible form, the three worlds are trembling with fear, O
great-souled Being!
Amee hi twaam surasanghaah vishanti
Kechid bheetaah praanjalayo grinanti;
Swasteetyuktwaa maharshisiddhasanghaah
Stuvanti twaam stutibhih pushkalaabhih.
21. Verily, into Thee enter these hosts of gods; some extol Thee in fear with joined palms:
“May it be well.” Saying thus, bands of great sages and perfected ones praise Thee with complete
hymns.
Rudraadityaa vasavo ye cha saadhyaa
Vishwe’shvinau marutashchoshmapaashcha;
Gandharvayakshaasurasiddhasanghaa
Veekshante twaam vismitaashchaiva sarve.
