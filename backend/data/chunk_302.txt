For I am the abode of Brahman, the immortal and the immutable, of everlasting Dharma
and of absolute bliss.

Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the fourteenth discourse
entitled:
“The Yoga of the Division Of the Three Gunas”
XV
THE YOGA OF THE SUPREME SPIRIT
Summary of Fifteenth Discourse
This discourse is entitled “Purushottama Yoga” or the “Yoga of the Supreme Person”. Here
Lord Krishna tells us about the ultimate source of this visible phenomenal universe from which all
things have come into being, just like a great tree with all its roots, trunk, branches, twigs, leaves,
flowers and fruits which spring forth from the earth, which itself supports the tree and in which it is
rooted.
