In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one,—the path of
knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogis!
Na karmanaam anaarambhaan naishkarmyam purusho’shnute;
Na cha sannyasanaad eva siddhim samadhigacchati.
4. Not by the non-performance of actions does man reach actionlessness, nor by mere
renunciation does he attain to perfection.
COMMENTARY: Even if a man abandons action, his mind may be active. One cannot
reach perfection or freedom from action or knowledge of the Self, merely by renouncing action. He
must possess knowledge of the Self.
Na hi kashchit kshanamapi jaatu tishthatyakarmakrit;
Kaaryate hyavashah karma sarvah prakritijair gunaih.
