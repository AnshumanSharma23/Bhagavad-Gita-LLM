Help comes quickly where the Gita is recited and, O Earth, I ever dwell where it is read,
heard, taught and contemplated upon!
Geetaashraye’ham tishthaami geetaa me chottamam griham;
Geetaajnaanam upaashritya treen Uokaan paalayaamyaham.
7. I take refuge in the Gita, and the Gita is My best abode. I protect the three worlds with the
knowledge of the Gita.
Geetaa me paramaa vidyaa brahmaroopaa na samshayah;
Ardhamaatraaksharaa nityaa swaanirvaachyapadaatmikaa.
8. The Gita is My highest science, which is doubtless of the form of Brahman, the Eternal,
the Ardhamatra (of the Pranava Om), the ineffable splendour of the Self.
Chidaanandena krishnena proktaa swamukhato’rjuna;
Vedatrayee paraanandaa tatwaarthajnaanasamyutaa.
9. It was spoken by the blessed Lord Krishna, the all-knowing, through His own mouth, to
Arjuna. It contains the essence of the Vedas—the knowledge of the Reality. It is full of supreme
bliss.
COMMENTARY: The Gita contains the cream of the Vedas and Upanishads.
