Therefore, I
shall teach thee such action (the nature of action and inaction), by knowing which thou shalt be
liberated from the evil (of Samsara, the world of birth and death).
Karmano hyapi boddhavyam boddhavyam cha vikarmanah;
Akarmanashcha boddhavyam gahanaa karmano gatih.
17. For, verily the true nature of action (enjoined by the scriptures) should be known, also
(that) of forbidden (or unlawful) action, and of inaction; hard to understand is the nature (path) of
action.
Karmanyakarma yah pashyed akarmani cha karma yah;
Sa buddhimaan manushyeshu sa yuktah kritsnakarmakrit.
18. He who seeth inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men; he is a
Yogi and performer of all actions.
COMMENTARY: It is the idea of agency, the idea of “I am the doer” that binds man to
worldliness. If this idea vanishes, action is no action at all. It does not bind one to worldliness. This
is inaction in action.
