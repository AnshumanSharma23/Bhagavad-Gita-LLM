be another superior to Thee in the three worlds, O Being of unequalled power?
Tasmaatpranamya pranidhaaya kaayam
Prasaadaye twaamahameeshameedyam;
Piteva putrasya sakheva sakhyuh
Priyah priyaayaarhasi deva sodhum.

THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
44. Therefore, bowing down, prostrating my body, I crave Thy forgiveness, O adorable
Lord! As a father forgives his son, a friend his (dear) friend, a lover his beloved, even so shouldst
Thou forgive me, O God!
Adrishtapoorvam hrishitoâ€™smi drishtwaa
Bhayena cha pravyathitam mano me;
Tadeva me darshaya deva roopam
Praseeda devesha jagannivaasa.
45. I am delighted, having seen what has never been seen before; and yet my mind is
distressed with fear.
