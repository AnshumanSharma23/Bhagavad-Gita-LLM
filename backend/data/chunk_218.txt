Under Me as supervisor, Nature produces the moving and the unmoving; because of
this, O Arjuna, the world revolves!
Avajaananti maam moodhaah maanusheem tanumaashritam;
Param bhaavamajaananto mama bhootamaheshwaram.
11. Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being as the great
Lord of (all) beings.
COMMENTARY: Fools who do not have discrimination despise Me, dwelling in human
form. I have taken this body in order to bless My devotees. These fools have no knowledge of My
higher Being. I am the great Lord, the Supreme.
Moghaashaa moghakarmaano moghajnaanaa vichetasah;
Raakshaseemaasureem chaiva prakritim mohineem shritaah.
12. Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge and senseless, they verily are
possessed of the deceitful nature of demons and undivine beings.
Mahaatmaanastu maam paartha daiveem prakritimaashritaah;
Bhajantyananyamanaso jnaatwaa bhootaadimavyayam.
