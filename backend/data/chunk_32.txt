They cannot
hope to understand the teachings of the Gita as their wisdom has been destroyed by illusion and
they have embraced the nature of demons. May the Lord grant them a subtle and pure intellect,
xiii
inner spiritual strength and right understanding to comprehend the teachings of the Gita in their
proper light and live in their spirit!
Some ignorant people say: “Lord Krishna was not God. He was not an Avatara or
Incarnation. He was a passionate cowherd who lustfully played with the Gopis”.
What was the age of Lord Krishna at that time? Was He not a boy of seven? Could there
have been a tinge of passion in Him? Who can understand the secret of the Rasa Lila and Madhurya
Bhava—the culmination of the highest state of devotion or total surrender to the Lord? It is only
Narada, Sukadeva, Chaitanya, Mira, Ramananda and the Gopis who could understand the secret of
the Rasa Lila.
