In accordance with this view, the first six
discourses deal with the path of action or Karma Yoga, that is, the nature of “Thou”. It is called the
Twam-pada. The next six discourses explain the path of devotion, the nature of “That”. This is
called the Tat-pada. The concluding six discourses treat of the path of knowledge, the nature of the
middle term “Art”. Hence, it is called the Asi-pada, which establishes the identity of the individual
soul with the Supreme Soul.
The eighteen discourses are not woven in a discordant manner. Each one is intimately or
vitally connected with its precedent.
Arjuna became very despondent. Lord Krishna’s opening remarks in the second discourse,
which bespeak of the immortality of the soul, open his eyes and give him strength and courage.
Arjuna then learns the technique of Karma Yoga and renunciation of the fruits of actions.
