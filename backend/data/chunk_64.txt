I salute Sri Krishna, the world-teacher, son of Vasudeva, the destroyer of Kamsa and
Chanura, the supreme bliss of Devaki!
Bheeshmadronatataa jayadrathajalaa gaandhaaraneelotpalaa;
Shalyagraahavatee kripena vahanee karnena velaakulaa;
Ashwatthaama-vikarna-ghora-makaraa duryodhanaavartinee;
Sotteernaa khalu paandavai rananadee kaivartakah keshavah.

BHAGAVAD GITA
6. With Kesava as the helmsman, verily was crossed by the Pandavas the battle-river, whose
banks were Bhishma and Drona, whose water was Jayadratha, whose blue lotus was the king of
Gandhara, whose crocodile was Salya, whose current was Kripa, whose billow was Karna, whose
terrible alligators were Vikarna and Asvatthama, whose whirlpool was Duryodhana.
Paaraasharya vachah sarojamamalam geetaarthagandhotkatam;
Naanaakhyaanakakesaram harikathaa sambodhanaabodhitam;
Loke sajjana shatpadairaharahah pepeeyamaanam mudaa;
Bhooyaadbhaaratapankajam kalimala pradhwamsinah shreyase.
