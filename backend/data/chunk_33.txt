The Gopis only are qualified for this divine sport.
Did He not play miracles when He was a boy? Did He not show that He was the Avatara of
Lord Hari? Did He not show His Cosmic Form to His mother when He was only a baby? Did He not
subdue the serpent, Kaliya, by standing on its hood? Did He not multiply Himself as countless
Krishnas for the satisfaction of the Gopis? Who were the Gopis? Were they not God-intoxicated
beings who saw Krishna alone everywhere, even in themselves? The sound of the flute would throw
them in a state of ecstasy or holy communion.
