But they have no attachment to the body and other
objects of enjoyment and, therefore, are not affected mentally. They are ever serene, self-contented
and self-satisfied. They do not long for objects not attained nor weep over things lost.
Another objector says: “In the Gita, XVIII.61, Lord Krishna says, ‘The Lord dwells in the
hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings, by His illusive power, to revolve as if mounted on
a machine!’ Is man then a perfect slave? Is he like a straw tossed about here and there? Has he not
any free will to act?”
Krishna tries His best to persuade Arjuna to do his duty. He wants to extract work from him.
So He speaks of Arjuna’s utter helplessness. In VI.5, Krishna preaches about right exertion: “Let a
man lift himself by his own Self alone, let him not lower himself; for this self is the friend of oneself
and this self alone is the enemy of oneself”.
Being under the sway of one’s nature, the natural duties can never be forsaken.
