What is wanted is the renunciation of egoism and desires.
Saankhyayogau prithagbaalaah pravadanti na panditaah;
Ekam apyaasthitah samyag ubhayor vindate phalam.
4. Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and the Yoga of action or the performance of
action as though they are distinct and different; he who is truly established in one obtains the fruits
of both.
Yatsaankhyaih praapyate sthaanam tad yogair api gamyate;
Ekam saankhyam cha yogam cha yah pashyati sa pashyati.
5. That place which is reached by the Sankhyas or the Jnanis is reached by the (Karma)
Yogis. He sees who sees knowledge and the performance of action (Karma Yoga) as one.

BHAGAVAD GITA
Sannyaasastu mahaabaaho duhkham aaptuma yogatah;
Yogayukto munir brahma na chirenaadhigacchati.
6. But renunciation, O mighty-armed Arjuna, is hard to attain without Yoga; the

Yogayukto vishuddhaatmaa vijitaatmaa jitendriyah;
Sarvabhootaatmabhootaatmaa kurvannapi na lipyate.
