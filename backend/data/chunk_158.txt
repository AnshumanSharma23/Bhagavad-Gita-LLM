He who performs actions, offering them to Brahman and abandoning attachment, is not
tainted by sin as a lotus leaf by water.
Kaayena manasaa buddhyaa kevalair indriyair api;
Yoginah karma kurvanti sangam tyaktwaatmashuddhaye.
11. Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body, mind, intellect
and also by the senses, for the purification of the self.
Yuktah karmaphalam tyaktwaa shaantim aapnoti naishthikeem;
Ayuktah kaamakaarena phale sakto nibadhyate.
12. The united one (the well poised or the harmonised), having abandoned the fruit of
action, attains to the eternal peace; the non-united only (the unsteady or the unbalanced), impelled
by desire and attached to the fruit, is bound.

THE YOGA OF RENUNCIATION OF ACTION
Sarvakarmaani manasaa sannyasyaaste sukham vashee;
Navadwaare pure dehee naiva kurvan na kaarayan.
