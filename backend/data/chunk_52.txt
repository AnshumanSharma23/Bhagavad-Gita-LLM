Teach me the Gita. Let me hear it directly from Thy
lips once more.
O Thou invisible One! O adorable and Supreme One! Thou penetratest and permeatest this
vast universe from the unlimited space down to the tiny blade of grass at my feet. Thou art the basis
of all names and forms. Thou art the apple of my eye, the divine love of my heart, the life of my life,
the very soul of my soul, the illuminator of my intellect and senses, the sweet mystic music of my
heart, and the substance of my physical, mental and causal bodies.
I recognise Thee alone as the mighty ruler of this universe and the inner controller of my
three bodies. I prostrate again and again before Thee, my Lord. Thou art my sole refuge. I trust Thee
alone, O ocean of mercy and love! Elevate, enlighten, guide and protect me. Remove the obstacles
on my spiritual path. Remove the veil of ignorance.
O Thou supreme world-teacher! I cannot bear any longer, even for a second, the miseries of
this physical body, this life and this worldly existence.
