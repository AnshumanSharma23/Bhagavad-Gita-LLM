He adds
that without faith in this knowledge man fails to reach God and is reborn to suffer.
Now the Lord proceeds to describe His nature as the eternal, all-comprehensive Truth. He is
everything that is invisible and visible. He pervades everything that exists. He creates everything,
sustains everything, and when final dissolution takes place, absorbs everything into Himself. He
manifests them again when the next creation begins. All beings who are ignorant of this knowledge
are caught helplessly in the cycle of birth and death. In the midst of this creation, preservation and
dissolution of the universe, the Lord stands as a silent witness, unaffected and unattached. He is the
sole director, sustainer and supervisor of His Cosmic Prakriti.
Ignorant beings are not able to recognise the Lord in one who has realised Him. Although
these cruel beings assume a human form, their nature is that of demons.
