But distinct is the Supreme Purusha called the highest Self, the indestructible Lord who,
pervading the three worlds, sustains them.
Yasmaat ksharam ateeto’hamaksharaadapi chottamah;
Ato’smi loke vede cha prathitah purushottamah.
18. As I transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, I am declared as
the highest Purusha in the world and in the Vedas.
Yo maamevam asammoodho jaanaati purushottamam;
Sa sarvavidbhajati maam sarvabhaavena bhaarata.
19. He who, undeluded, knows Me thus as the highest Purusha, he, knowing all, worships
Me with his whole being (heart), O Arjuna!
Iti guhyatamam shaastram idamuktam mayaa’nagha;
Etadbuddhwaa buddhimaan syaat kritakrityashcha bhaarata.
