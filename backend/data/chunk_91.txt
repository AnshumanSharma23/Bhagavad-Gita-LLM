That firm man whom surely these afflict not, O chief among men, to whom pleasure and
pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality!
Naasato vidyate bhaavo naabhaavo vidyate satah;
Ubhayorapi drishtoâ€™ntastwanayos tattwadarshibhih.
16. The unreal hath no being; there is no non-being of the Real; the truth about both has been

COMMENTARY: What is changing must always be unreal. What is constant or
permanent must always be real. The Atman or the eternal, all-pervading Self ever exists. It is the
only Reality. This phenomenal world of names and forms is ever changing. Names and forms are
subject to decay and death. Hence they are unreal or impermanent.
Avinaashi tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idam tatam;
Vinaasham avyayasyaasya na kashchit kartum arhati.
17. Know That to be indestructible, by whom all this is pervaded. None can cause the
destruction of That, the Imperishable.
COMMENTARY: The Self pervades all objects like ether.
