Those who are
self-controlled and who are endowed with faith can reap the full benefit of the Gita, which is the
science of the Soul.
The Gita Jayanti (birthdate of the Gita) is celebrated throughout India by the admirers and
lovers of this unique book on the 11th day (Ekadashi) of the bright half of the month of Margasirsha
according to the Hindu almanac. It was the day on which the scripture was revealed to the world by
Sanjaya.
In all the spiritual literature of the world there is no book so elevating and inspiring as the
Gita. It expounds very lucidly the cardinal principles or the fundamentals of the Hindu religion and
Hindu Dharma. It is the source of all wisdom. It is your great guide. It is your supreme teacher. It is
an inexhaustible spiritual treasure. It is a fountain of bliss. It is an ocean of knowledge. It is full of
divine splendour and grandeur.
The Gita is the cream of the Vedas. It is the essence of the soul-elevating Upanishads.
