In the middle of the two armies, place my chariot, O Krishna, so that I may behold
those who stand here, desirous to fight, and know with whom I must fight when the battle begins.
Yotsyamaanaan avekshe’ham ya ete’tra samaagataah;
Dhaartaraashtrasya durbuddher yuddhe priyachikeershavah.
23. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight, wishing to please in battle
Duryodhana, the evil-minded.
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Evamukto hrisheekesho gudaakeshena bhaarata;
Senayor ubhayormadhye sthaapayitwaa rathottamam.
Sanjaya said:

THE YOGA OF THE DESPONDENCY OF ARJUNA
24. Being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna, having stationed that best of chariots, O
Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies,
Bheeshmadronapramukhatah sarveshaam cha maheekshitaam;
Uvaacha paartha pashyaitaan samavetaan kuroon iti.
