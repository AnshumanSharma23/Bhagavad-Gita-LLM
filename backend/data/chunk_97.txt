Further, having regard to thy own duty, thou shouldst not waver, for there is nothing
higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.

SANKHYA YOGA
COMMENTARY: To a Kshatriya (one born in the warrior or ruling class) nothing is more
welcome than a righteous war.
Yadricchayaa chopapannam swargadwaaram apaavritam;
Sukhinah kshatriyaah paartha labhante yuddham eedrisham.
32. Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Arjuna, who are called upon to fight in such a battle that
comes of itself as an open door to heaven!
COMMENTARY: The scriptures declare that if a warrior dies for a righteous cause on the
battlefield he at once ascends to heaven.
Atha chettwam imam dharmyam samgraamam na karishyasi;
Tatah swadharmam keertim cha hitwaa paapam avaapsyasi.
33. But, if thou wilt not fight in this righteous war, then, having abandoned thine duty and
fame, thou shalt incur sin.
Akeertim chaapi bhootaani kathayishyanti teâ€™vyayaam;
Sambhaavitasya chaakeertir maranaad atirichyate.
34.
