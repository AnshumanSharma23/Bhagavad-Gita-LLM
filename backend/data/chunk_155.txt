Renunciation of actions, O Krishna, Thou praisest, and again Yoga! Tell me conclusively
which is the better of the two.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Sannyaasah karmayogashcha nihshreyasakaraa vubhau;
Tayostu karmasannyaasaat karmayogo vishishyate.
The Blessed Lord said:
2. Renunciation and the Yoga of action both lead to the highest bliss; but of the two, the
Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action.
Jneyah sa nityasannyaasi yo na dweshti na kaangkshati;
Nirdwandwo hi mahaabaaho sukham bandhaat pramuchyate.
3. He should be known as a perpetual Sannyasin who neither hates nor desires; for, free
from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily set free from bondage!
COMMENTARY: A man does not become a Sannyasin by merely giving up actions due
to laziness, ignorance, some family quarrel or calamity or unemployment. A true Sannyasin is one
who has neither attachment nor aversion to anything. Physical renunciation of objects is no
renunciation at all.
