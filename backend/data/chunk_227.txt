He will for ever
have his life and being in the Lord alone.

Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the ninth discourse entitled:
“The Yoga of the Kingly Science & the Kingly Secret”
X
THE YOGA OF THE DIVINE GLORIES
Summary of Tenth Discourse
Krishna tells Arjuna that even the Devas and highly evolved souls fail to understand how He
projects Himself as the universe and all its manifestations. He goes on to describe the various
qualities that beings manifest according to their Karmas. All these qualities—wisdom, truth,
contentment, etc.—originate from Him.
The true devotees of the Lord are wholly absorbed in Him.
