The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Visvedevas, the two Asvins, Maruts, the manes
and hosts of celestial singers, Yakshas, demons and the perfected ones, are all looking at Thee in
great astonishment.
Roopam mahat te bahuvaktranetram
Mahaabaaho bahubaahoorupaadam;
Bahoodaram bahudamshtraakaraalam
Drishtwaa lokaah pravyathitaastathaaâ€™ham.
23. Having beheld Thy immeasurable form with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-armed,
with many arms, thighs and feet, with many stomachs, and fearful with many teeth, the worlds are
terrified and so am I!
Nabhahsprisham deeptamanekavarnam
Vyaattaananam deeptavishaalanetram;
Drishtwaa hi twaam pravyathitaantaraatmaa
Dhritim na vindaami shamam cha vishno.
