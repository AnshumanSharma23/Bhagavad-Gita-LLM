And among all the Yogis, he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me,
worships Me, he is deemed by Me to be the most devout.

BHAGAVAD GITA
Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the sixth discourse entitled:
“The Yoga of Meditation”
VII
THE YOGA OF WISDOM AND REALISATION
Summary of Seventh Discourse
Sri Krishna tells Arjuna that the supreme Godhead has to be realised in both its transcendent
and immanent aspects. The Yogi who has reached this summit has nothing more to know.
This complete union with the Lord is difficult of attainment.
