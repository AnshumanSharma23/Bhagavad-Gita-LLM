This is the experience of everyone in this world, the drama of
the ascent of man from a state of utter dejection, sorrow and total breakdown and hopelessness to a
state of perfect understanding, clarity, renewed strength and triumph.
Each discourse holds for you an invaluable new lesson and imparts a new understanding of
yourself in a marvellous way. The mystery of man, this world and God, is explained as perhaps
nowhere else. The workings of your mind—the real problem to your welfare and happiness—how
to overcome it, what the path to blessedness is, as also the path to perdition, the secret of
self-mastery and the way to peace amidst your daily activities and duties—all these and more you
will find in this great treasure. It is yours by which to enrich your life.
To the Western reader I would suggest that he carefully reads through the entire book once.
Then he should commence it a second time.
