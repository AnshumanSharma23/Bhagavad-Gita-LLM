The surest way of
transcending this Samsara or worldly life is by wielding the excellent weapon of dispassion and
non-attachment.
In verses four and five of this discourse the Lord tells us how one goes beyond this visible
Samsara and attains the supreme, imperishable status, attaining which one does not have to return to
this mortal world of pain and death.
Lord Krishna also describes for us the wonderful mystery of His Presence in this universe
and the supreme place He occupies in sustaining everything here. The Lord declares that it is a part
of Himself that manifests here as the individual soul in each body. He Himself is the indwelling
Oversoul beyond the self. He is the effulgence inherent in the sun, moon and fire. He is present as
the nourishing element in the earth. He is the inner witness of all beings. He is the supreme Knower
even beyond Vedic knowledge.
