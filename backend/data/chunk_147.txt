Others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming, and the incoming in the
outgoing, restraining the courses of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the
restraint of the breath.
COMMENTARY: Some Yogis practise inhalation, some practise exhalation, and some
retention of breath. This is Pranayama.
Apare niyataahaaraah praanaan praaneshu juhwati;
Sarve’pyete yajnavido yajnakshapita kalmashaah.
30. Others who regulate their diet offer life-breaths in life-breaths; all these are knowers of
sacrifice, whose sins are all destroyed by sacrifice.
Yajnashishtaamritabhujo yaanti brahma sanaatanam;
Naayam loko’styayajnasya kuto’nyah kurusattama.
31. Those who eat the remnants of the sacrifice, which are like nectar, go to the eternal
Brahman.
