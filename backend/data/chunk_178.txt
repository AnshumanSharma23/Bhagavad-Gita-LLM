With the mind harmonised by Yoga he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings
in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.
Yo maam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi pashyati;
Tasyaaham na pranashyaami sa cha me na pranashyati.

THE YOGA OF MEDITATION
30. He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, he does not become separated
from Me nor do I become separated from him.
COMMENTARY: The Lord describes here the effect of oneness.
Sarvabhootasthitam yo maam bhajatyekatwamaasthitah;
Sarvathaa vartamaano’pi sa yogee mayi vartate.
31. He who, being established in unity, worships Me who dwells in all beings,—that Yogi
abides in Me, whatever may be his mode of living.
Aatmaupamyena sarvatra samam pashyati yo’rjuna;
Sukham vaa yadi vaa duhkham sa yogee paramo matah.
32.
