Hence the
Pandavas decided to live separately, sharing half of their kingdom.
The Pandavasâ€™ pomp, wealth and glory displayed during the Rajasuya Yajna aroused deep
jealousy and greed in the mind of Duryodhana, the chief of the Kauravas, who, with the cunning
advice of his uncle, Sakuni, invited Yudhisthira to a game of dice and fraudulently defeated him,
whereby all his wealth and possessions, including Draupadi, were lost. Finally it was settled that the
Pandavas, including Draupadi, should repair to the forest for twelve years in exile, after which they
had to live incognito for another year, untraced by the Kauravas. During this period the kingdom
was to be ruled by the wicked Duryodhana.
Having successfully completed these thirteen years of exile, facing many obstacles and
dangers instigated by the Kauravas, the Pandavas, as per the terms of the agreement, approached the
Kauravas for their share of the kingdom.
