Among thousands of men, one perchance strives for perfection; even among those
successful strivers, only one perchance knows Me in essence.
Bhoomiraapo’nalo vaayuh kham mano buddhireva cha;
Ahamkaara iteeyam me bhinnaa prakritirashtadhaa.
4. Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoism—thus is My Nature divided
eightfold.
Apareyamitastwanyaam prakritim viddhi me paraam;
Jeevabhootaam mahaabaaho yayedam dhaaryate jagat.
5. This is the inferior Prakriti, O mighty-armed (Arjuna)! Know thou as different from it My
higher Prakriti (Nature), the very life-element by which this world is upheld.
Etadyoneeni bhootaani sarvaaneetyupadhaaraya;
Aham kritsnasya jagatah prabhavah pralayastathaa.
6. Know that these two (My higher and lower Natures) are the womb of all beings. So, I am
the source and dissolution of the whole universe.
Mattah parataram naanyat kinchidasti dhananjaya;
Mayi sarvamidam protam sootre maniganaa iva.
