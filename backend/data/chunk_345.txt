That by which one sees the one indestructible Reality in all beings, not separate in all the
separate beings—know thou that knowledge to be Sattwic (pure).
Prithaktwena tu yajjnaanam naanaabhaavaan prithagvidhaan;
Vetti sarveshu bhooteshu tajjnaanam viddhi raajasam.
21. But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct kinds as different
from one another—know thou that knowledge to be Rajasic (passionate).
Yattu kritsnavadekasmin kaarye saktamahaitukam;
Atattwaarthavadalpam cha tattaamasamudaahritam.
22. But that which clings to one single effect as if it were the whole, without reason, without
foundation in Truth, and trivial—that is declared to be Tamasic (dark).
Niyatam sangarahitam araagadweshatah kritam;
Aphalaprepsunaa karma yattat saattwikamuchyate.
23.
