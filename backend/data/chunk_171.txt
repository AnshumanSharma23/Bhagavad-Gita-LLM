The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and the wisdom (of the Self), who has
conquered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone and gold are the same, is said to
be harmonised (that is, is said to have attained the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi).
Suhrinmitraary udaaseena madhyastha dweshya bandhushu;
Saadhushwapi cha paapeshu samabuddhirvishishyate.
