Know thou Rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst (for sensual
enjoyment) and attachment; it binds fast, O Arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action!
Tamastwajnaanajam viddhi mohanam sarvadehinaam;
Pramaadaalasyanidraabhis tannibadhnaati bhaarata.
8. But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings; it binds fast,
O Arjuna, by heedlessness, sleep and indolence!
Sattwam sukhe sanjayati rajah karmani bhaarata;
Jnaanamaavritya tu tamah pramaade sanjayatyuta.
9. Sattwa attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while Tamas, shrouding
knowledge, attaches to heedlessness only!
Rajastamashchaabhibhooya sattwam bhavati bhaarata;
Rajah sattwam tamashchaiva tamah sattwam rajastathaa.
