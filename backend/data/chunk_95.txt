Therefore, one should not grieve.
Jaatasya hi dhruvo mrityur dhruvam janma mritasya cha;
Tasmaad aparihaaryeâ€™rthe na twam shochitum arhasi.
27. For, certain is death for the born and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the
inevitable thou shouldst not grieve.
Avyaktaadeeni bhootaani vyaktamadhyaani bhaarata;
Avyakta nidhanaanyeva tatra kaa paridevanaa.
28. Beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their middle state, O Arjuna,
and unmanifested again in their end! What is there to grieve about?
COMMENTARY: The physical body is a combination of the five elements. It is perceived
by the physical eye only after the five elements have entered into such combination. After death the
body disintegrates and all the five elements return to their source. The body cannot be perceived
now. It can be perceived only in the middle state.
