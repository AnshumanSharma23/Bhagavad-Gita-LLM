If, filled with egoism, thou thinkest: “I will not fight”, vain is this, thy resolve; Nature
will compel thee.
Swabhaavajena kaunteya nibaddhah swena karmanaa;
Kartum necchasi yanmohaat karishyasyavasho’pi tat.
60. O Arjuna, bound by thy own Karma (action) born of thy own nature, that which from
delusion thou wishest not to do, even that thou shalt do helplessly!
COMMENTARY: Thou wilt be forced to fight because of thy nature. It will compel thee to
fight, much against thy will.
Eeshwarah sarvabhootaanaam hriddeshe’rjuna tishthati;
Bhraamayan sarvabhootaani yantraaroodhaani maayayaa.
61. The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings, by His illusive
power, to revolve as if mounted on a machine!
Tameva sharanam gaccha sarvabhaavena bhaarata;
Tatprasaadaatparaam shaantim sthaanam praapsyasi shaashwatam.
