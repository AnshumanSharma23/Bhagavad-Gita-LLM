In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low,
made of a cloth, a skin and kusha grass, one over the other,
Tatraikaagram manah kritwaa yatachittendriyakriyah;
Upavishyaasane yunjyaadyogamaatmavishuddhaye.
12. There, having made the mind one-pointed, with the actions of the mind and the senses
controlled, let him, seated on the seat, practise Yoga for the purification of the self.
Samam kaayashirogreevam dhaarayannachalam sthirah;
Samprekshya naasikaagram swam dishashchaanavalokayan.
13. Let him firmly hold his body, head and neck erect and perfectly still, gazing at the tip of
his nose, without looking around.
Prashaantaatmaa vigatabheer brahmachaarivrate sthitah;
Manah samyamya macchitto yukta aaseeta matparah.
