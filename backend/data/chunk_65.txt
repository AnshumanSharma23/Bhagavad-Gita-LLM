May this lotus of the Mahabharata, born in the lake of the words of Vyasa, sweet with the
fragrance of the meaning of the Gita, with many stories as its stamens, fully opened by the
discourses of Hari, the destroyer of the sins of Kali, and drunk joyously by the bees of good men in
the world, become day by day the bestower of good to us!
Mookam karoti vaachaalam pangum langhayate girim;
Yatkripaa tamaham vande paramaanandamaadhavam.
8. I salute that Madhava, the source of supreme bliss, whose Grace makes the dumb
eloquent and the cripple cross mountains!
Yam brahmaa varunendrarudramarutah stunwanti divyaih stavaih,
Vedaih saangapadakramopanishadair gaayanti yam saamagaah,
Dhyaanaavasthitatadgatena manasaa pashyanti yam yogino,
Yasyaantam na viduh suraasuraganaa devaaya tasmai namah.
