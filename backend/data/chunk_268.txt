He thus effects union with the Lord and attains not only His formless aspect but also the
Lord as the manifest universe.
The path of knowledge, whereby the aspirant meditates on the formless Brahman, is more
difficult as he has to give up his attachment to the body from the very beginning. He has to have
dispassion for the things of the world.
How to practise devotion? Krishna asks Arjuna to fix his entire mind on Him. As often as
the mind wanders it should be brought back to the Lord. If this process of concentration is difficult
he should dedicate all his actions to Him, feeling that it is His power that activates everything. If this
also is beyond his ability, he should offer all his actions to the Lord, abandoning the desire for their
fruits. He should take complete refuge in Him. The devotee who surrenders himself to the Lord
attains perfect peace.
The Lord goes on to describe the qualities that a true devotee possesses.
