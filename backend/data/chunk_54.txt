Thee alone I adore; Thee
alone I worship; on Thee alone I meditate in Thee alone I take sole refuge.

PRAYER TO LORD KRISHNA
GITA MAHATMYA
GLORY OF THE GITA
(To be read at the end of the dayâ€™s Gita study)
Sri Ganeshaaya Namah! Gopaalakrishnaaya Namah!
Dharovaacha:
Bhagavan parameshaana bhaktiravyabhichaarinee;
Praarabdham bhujyamaanasya katham bhavati he prabho.
The Earth said:
1. O Bhagavan, the Supreme Lord! How can unflinching devotion arise in him who is
immersed in his Prarabdha Karmas (worldly life), O Lord?
Sri Vishnuruvaacha:
Praarabdham bhujyamaano hi geetaabhyaasaratah sadaa;
Sa muktah sa sukhee loke karmanaa nopalipyate.
Lord Vishnu said:
2. Though engaged in the performance of worldly duties, one who is regular in the study of
the Gita becomes free. He is the happy man in this world. He is not bound by Karma.
Mahaapaapaadipaapaani geetaadhyaanam karoti chet;
Kwachit sparsham na kurvanti nalineedalam ambuvat.
