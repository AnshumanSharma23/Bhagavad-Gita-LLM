Eventually, Arjuna placed his foot on the highest rung, attained the supreme knowledge of the
Self and exclaimed in joy: “O my Lord! my delusion has been destroyed. I have attained knowledge
through Thy Grace. I am firm. All my doubts have now vanished in toto. I will act according to Thy
word”.
You can become a liberated sage by annihilating the ego and the currents of likes and
dislikes; by annihilating desires and cravings and destroying their residual potencies. Thus, you can
rest in your true essential nature as Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute and still be active in the
affairs of the world. Now you will not be bound by your actions since the idea of doership has been
destroyed by the attainment of knowledge of the Self.
