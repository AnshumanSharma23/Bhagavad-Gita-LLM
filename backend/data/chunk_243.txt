But of what avail to thee is the knowledge of all these details, O Arjuna? I exist,
supporting this whole world by one part of Myself.

Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the tenth discourse entitled:
“The Yoga of the Divine Glories”
XI
THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
Summary of Eleventh Discourse
Arjuna’s doubts having been removed through a clear description of the nature of the Atman
and the origin and destruction of all created things, he is now ready to behold the Cosmic Vision.
Krishna grants him the divine sight by means of which Arjuna beholds the Lord as the vast
Cosmic Manifestation. The vision is at once all-comprehensive and simultaneous. In every
direction Arjuna sees the Lord as the entire universe.
