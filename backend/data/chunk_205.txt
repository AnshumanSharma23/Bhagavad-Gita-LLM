That which is declared imperishable by those who know the Vedas, that which the
self-controlled (ascetics) and passion-free enter, that desiring which celibacy is practised—that
goal I will declare to thee in brief.
Sarvadwaaraani samyamya mano hridi nirudhya cha;
Moordhnyaadhaayaatmanah praanamaasthito yogadhaaranaam.
12. Having closed all the gates, confined the mind in the heart and fixed the life-breath in the
head, engaged in the practice of concentration,
Omityekaaksharam brahma vyaaharan maamanusmaran;
Yah prayaati tyajan deham sa yaati paramaam gatim.
13. Uttering the monosyllable Om—the Brahman—remembering Me always, he who
departs thus, leaving the body, attains to the supreme goal.
Ananyachetaah satatam yo maam smarati nityashah;
Tasyaaham sulabhah paartha nityayuktasya yoginah.
