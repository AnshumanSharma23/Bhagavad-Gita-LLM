Sri Krishna quotes the example of Janaka, the great sage-king of
India, who continued to rule his kingdom even after attaining God-realisation.
Prakriti or Nature is made up of the three qualities—Rajas, Tamas and Sattwa. The Atman is
beyond these three qualities and their functions. Only when knowledge of this fact dawns in man
does he attain perfection.
The Lord tells Arjuna that each one should do his duty according to his nature, and that
doing duty that is suited to one’s nature in the right spirit of detachment will lead to perfection.
Arjuna raises the question as to why man commits such actions that cloud his mind and drag
him downwards, by force, as it were. Sri Krishna answers that it is desire that impels man to lose his
discrimination and understanding, and thus commit wrong actions. Desire is the root cause of all
evil actions.
