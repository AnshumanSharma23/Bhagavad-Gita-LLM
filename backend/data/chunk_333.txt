Therefore, with the utterance of “Om” are the acts of gift, sacrifice and austerity as
enjoined in the scriptures always begun by the students of Brahman.
Tadityanabhisandhaaya phalam yajnatapah kriyaah;
Daanakriyaashcha vividhaah kriyante mokshakaangkshibhih.
25. Uttering Tat, without aiming at the fruits, are the acts of sacrifice and austerity and the
various acts of gift performed by the seekers of liberation.
Sadbhaave saadhubhaave cha sadityetatprayujyate;
Prashaste karmani tathaa sacchabdah paartha yujyate.
26. The word Sat is used in the sense of reality and of goodness; and so also, O Arjuna, it is
used in the sense of an auspicious act!
Yajne tapasi daane cha sthitih saditi chochyate;
Karma chaiva tadartheeyam sadityevaabhidheeyate.
