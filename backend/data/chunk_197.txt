Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta (pertaining to the elements), the Adhidaiva
(pertaining to the gods), and Adhiyajna (pertaining to the sacrifice), know Me even at the time of
death, steadfast in mind.
COMMENTARY: They who are steadfast in mind, who have taken refuge in Me, who
know Me as knowledge of elements on the physical plane, as knowledge of gods on the celestial or
mental plane, as knowledge of sacrifice in the realm of sacrifice,—they are not affected by death.
