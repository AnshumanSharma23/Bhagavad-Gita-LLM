It has a message of solace, freedom, salvation, perfection and
peace for all human beings.
This sacred scripture is like the great Manasarovar lake for monks, renunciates and thirsting
aspirants to sport in. It is the ocean of bliss in which seekers of Truth swim with joy and ecstasy. If
the philosopher’s stone touches a piece of iron even at one point, the whole of it is transformed into
gold. Even so, if you live in the spirit of even one verse of the Gita, you will doubtless be transmuted
into divinity. All your miseries will come to an end and you will attain the highest goal of
life—immortality and eternal peace.
The study of the Gita alone is sufficient for daily Swadhyaya (scriptural study). You will
find here a solution for all your doubts. The more you study it with devotion and faith, the more you
will acquire deeper knowledge, penetrative insight and clear, right thinking.

The Bhagavad Gita is a gospel for the whole world. It is meant for the generality of
mankind.
