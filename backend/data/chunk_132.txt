Whenever there is a prevalence of unrighteousness and the world is ruled by the
forces of darkness, the Lord manifests Himself to destroy these adverse forces and to establish
peace, order and harmony. Hence we see the appearance of the great saviours of the world.
What is the secret of Yogic action? This the Lord proceeds to explain to Arjuna. Even
though one is not engaged in action, but if the mind is active with the idea of doership and egoism,
then it is action in inaction. On the other hand, though engaged physically in intense action, if the
idea of agency is absent, if one feels that Prakriti does everything, it is inaction in action. The
liberated man is free from attachment and is always calm and serene though engaged in ceaseless
action. He is unaffected by the pairs of opposites like joy and grief, success and failure.
One who has true union with the Lord is not subject to rebirth. He attains immortality.
