When one has achieved complete self-mastery and self-control, when one has intense
faith and devotion, then true knowledge dawns within and one attains liberation and freedom from
all weaknesses and sins.
The Lord concludes by emphasising that the soul that doubts goes to destruction. Without
faith in oneself, in the scriptures and in the words of the preceptor, one cannot make any headway
on the spiritual path. It is doubt that prevents one from engaging in spiritual Sadhana and realising
the highest knowledge and bliss. By following the instructions of the Guru and through sincere
service, one’s doubts are rent asunder and divine knowledge manifests itself within. Spiritual
progress then goes on at a rapid pace.

Imam vivaswate yogam proktavaan aham avyayam;
Vivaswaan manave praaha manur ikshwaakave’braveet.
