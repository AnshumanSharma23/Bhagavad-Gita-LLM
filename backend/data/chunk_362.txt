Destroyed is my delusion as I have gained my memory (knowledge) through Thy Grace,
O Krishna! I am firm; my doubts are gone. I will act according to Thy word.

Ityaham vaasudevasya paarthasya cha mahaatmanah;
Samvaadam imam ashrausham adbhutam romaharshanam.

Yogam yogeshwaraat krishnaat saakshaat kathayatah swayam.
75. Through the Grace of Vyasa I have heard this supreme and most secret Yoga direct from
Krishna, the Lord of Yoga Himself declaring it.
