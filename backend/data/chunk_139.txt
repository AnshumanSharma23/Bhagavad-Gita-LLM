He who thus knows in true light My divine birth and action, after having abandoned the
body is not born again; he comes to Me, O Arjuna!
Veetaraagabhayakrodhaa manmayaa maam upaashritaah;
Bahavo jnaana tapasaa pootaa madbhaavam aagataah.

THE YOGA OF WISDOM
10. Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by
the fire of knowledge, many have attained to My Being.
Ye yathaa maam prapadyante taamstathaiva bhajaamyaham;
Mama vartmaanuvartante manushyaah paartha sarvashah.
11. In whatever way men approach Me, even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in
all ways, O Arjuna!
Kaangkshantah karmanaam siddhim yajanta iha devataah;
Kshipram hi maanushe loke siddhir bhavati karmajaa.
12. Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods, because success
is quickly attained by men through action.
Chaaturvarnyam mayaa srishtam gunakarma vibhaagashah;
Tasya kartaaram api maam viddhyakartaaram avyayam.
