But that firmness, O Arjuna, by which, on account of attachment and desire for reward,
one holds fast to Dharma, enjoyment of pleasures and earning of wealth—that firmness, O Arjuna,
is Rajasic!
Yayaa swapnam bhayam shokam vishaadam madameva cha;
Na vimunchati durmedhaa dhritih saa paartha taamasee.
35. That by which a stupid man does not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair and also
conceit—that firmness, O Arjuna, is Tamasic!
Sukham twidaaneem trividham shrinu me bharatarshabha;
Abhyaasaadramate yatra duhkhaantam cha nigacchati.
36. Now hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the threefold pleasure, in which one rejoices by
practice and surely comes to the end of pain!
Yattadagre vishamiva parinaame’mritopamam;
Tatsukham saattwikam proktam aatmabuddhiprasaadajam.
