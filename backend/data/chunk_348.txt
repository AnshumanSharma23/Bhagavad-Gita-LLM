Hear thou the threefold division of the intellect and firmness according to the Gunas, as I
declare them fully and distinctly, O Arjuna!
Pravrittim cha nivrittim cha karyaakaarye bhayaabhaye;
Bandhammoksham cha yaa vetti buddhih saa paartha saattwikee.
30. That which knows the path of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what
ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation—that intellect is Sattwic, O
Arjuna!
Yayaa dharmamadharmam cha kaaryam chaakaaryameva cha;
Ayathaavat prajaanaati buddhih saa paartha raajasee.
31. That by which one incorrectly understands Dharma and Adharma, and also what ought
to be done and what ought not to be done—that intellect, O Arjuna, is Rajasic!
COMMENTARY: That which is ordained in the scriptures is Dharma. That which hurls
you into the abyss of ignorance is Adharma.
