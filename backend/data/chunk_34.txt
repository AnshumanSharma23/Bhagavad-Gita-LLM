They were above body-consciousness.
Just listen to the fate of such people who cavil and carp at the Lord: “The foolish think of
Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My higher, immutable and most
excellent form”—VII.24; “Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being
as the great Lord of all beings”; “Empty of hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge and senseless,
they verily are possessed of the deceitful nature of demons and undivine beings”—IX.11-12;
“These cruel haters—the worst among men in the world—I hurl these evil-doers into the womb of
demons only”; “Entering into demoniacal wombs and deluded birth after birth, not attaining Me,
they thus fall, O Arjuna, into a condition lower than that”-XVI.19-20.
Some thoughtless people begin to entertain a doubt and say: “How could the Gita have been
taught to Arjuna on the battlefield in such a short time? It could not.” This is wrong. It was all a
revelation to Arjuna.
