Kill the enemies of ignorance and egoism and enter the
illimitable kingdom of God.
My silent adorations to Lord Ganesh, Lord Subramanya, Lord Rama, Sita Devi, Sri
Saraswathi, Sri Shankara, Bhagavan Vyasa, Sri Padmapadacharya, Sri Hastamalakacharya, Sri
Totakacharya, Sri Sureshvaracharya, Sri Jnana Dev, Sri Swami Visvananda, Sri Swami
Vishnudevananda, and all the Brahma Vidya Gurus and commentators on the Gita, through whose
Grace and blessings alone I was able to write this commentary! May their blessings be upon you all!
Glory, glory to the Gita! Glory to Lord Krishna, who placed the Gita before men of this
world to attain liberation! May His blessings be upon you all! May the Gita be your centre, ideal
and goal!
Blessed is the man who studies the Gita daily! Twice blessed is he who lives in the spirit of
the Gita! Thrice blessed is he who has realised the knowledge of the Gita or attained
Self-knowledge! Om Tat Sat! Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti!
Swami Sivananda
