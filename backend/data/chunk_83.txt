After failing to convince Sri Krishna through his seemingly wise thoughts,
Arjuna realises his helplessness and surrenders himself completely to the Lord, seeking His
guidance to get over the conflict of his mind.
The Lord takes pity on him and proceeds to enlighten him by various means. He explains to
Arjuna the imperishable nature of the Atman, for which there is no past, present and future. The
Atman never dies, therefore Arjuna should not grieve. As It transcends the five elements, namely,
earth, water, fire, air and ether, It cannot be cut, burnt or dried. It is unchanging and eternal.
Everyone experiences conditions like pleasure and pain, heat and cold, due to contact of
objects with the senses. The senses carry the sensations through the nerves to the mind.
