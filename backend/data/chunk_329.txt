of the study of the Vedas, are called austerity of speech.
COMMENTARY: It is said in the Manu Smriti: “One should speak what is true; one
should speak what is pleasant; one should not speak what is true if it is not pleasant, nor what is
pleasant if it is false. This is the ancient Dharma”. To be an austerity speech should combine all the
attributes mentioned in the above verse.
