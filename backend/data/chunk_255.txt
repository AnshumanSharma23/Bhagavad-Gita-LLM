found sticking in the gaps between the teeth, with their heads crushed to powder.
Yathaa nadeenaam bahavoâ€™mbuvegaah
Samudramevaabhimukhaah dravanti;
Tathaa tavaamee naralokaveeraah
Vishanti vaktraanyabhivijwalanti.

COMMENTARY: Arjuna sees all the warriors, whom he did not wish to kill, rushing to

Yathaa pradeeptam jwalanam patangaa
Vishanti naashaaya samriddhavegaah;
Tathaiva naashaaya vishanti lokaas
Tavaapi vaktraani samriddhavegaah.
