Learn from Me, O mighty-armed Arjuna, these five causes, as declared in the Sankhya
system for the accomplishment of all actions!
Adhishthaanam tathaa kartaa karanam cha prithagvidham;
Vividhaashcha prithakcheshtaa daivam chaivaatra panchamam.
14. The body, the doer, the various senses, the different functions of various sorts, and the
presiding Deity, also, the fifth,
Shareeravaangmanobhiryat karma praarabhate narah;
Nyaayyam vaa vipareetam vaa panchaite tasya hetavah.
15. Whatever action a man performs by his body, speech and mind, whether right or the
reverse, these five are its causes.
Tatraivam sati kartaaram aatmaanam kevalam tu yah;
Pashyatyakritabuddhitwaan na sa pashyati durmatih.
16. Now, such being the case, he who, owing to untrained understanding, looks upon his
Self, which is isolated, as the agent, he of perverted intelligence, sees not.
Yasya naahankrito bhaavo buddhiryasya na lipyate;
Hatwaapi sa imaam llokaan na hanti na nibadhyate.
