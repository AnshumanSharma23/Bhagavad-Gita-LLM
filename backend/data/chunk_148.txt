This world is not for the man who does not perform sacrifice; how then can he have the
other, O Arjuna?
COMMENTARY: They go to the eternal Brahman after attaining knowledge of the Self
through purification of the mind by performing the above sacrifices. He who does not perform any
of these is not fit even for this miserable world. How then can he hope to get a better world than this?
Evam bahuvidhaa yajnaa vitataa brahmano mukhe;
Karmajaan viddhi taan sarvaan evam jnaatwaa vimokshyase.
32. Thus, various kinds of sacrifices are spread out before Brahman (literally at the mouth or

Shreyaan dravyamayaadyajnaaj jnaanayajnah parantapa;
Sarvam karmaakhilam paartha jnaane parisamaapyate.
