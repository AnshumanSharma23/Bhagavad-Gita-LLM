He who knows Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all the
worlds and the friend of all beings, attains to peace.

Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna ends the fifth discourse entitled:
“The Yoga of Renunciation of Action”
VI
THE YOGA OF MEDITATION
Summary of Sixth Discourse
Sri Krishna emphasises once again that the Yogi or Sannyasin is one who has renounced the
fruits of actions, not the actions themselves. The performance of actions without an eye on their
fruits brings about the purification of the mind. Only a purified mind, a mind free from desires, can
engage itself in constant meditation on the Atman. Desire gives rise to imagination or Sankalpa,
which drives the soul into the field of action.
