Tell me again in detail, O Krishna, of Thy Yogic power and glory; for I am not satisfied
with what I have heard of Thy life-giving and nectar-like speech!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Hanta te kathayishyaami divyaa hyaatmavibhootayah;
Praadhaanyatah kurushreshtha naastyanto vistarasya me.
The Blessed Lord said:
19. Very well, now I will declare to thee My divine glories in their prominence, O Arjuna!
There is no end to their detailed description.
COMMENTARY: The Lordâ€™s divine glories are illimitable.
Ahamaatmaa gudaakesha sarvabhootaashayasthitah;
Ahamaadishcha madhyam cha bhootaanaamanta eva cha.
20. I am the Self, O Gudakesha, seated in the hearts of all beings! I am the beginning, the
middle and also the end of all beings.
