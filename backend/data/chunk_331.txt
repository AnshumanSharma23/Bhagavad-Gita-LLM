give in a fit place and time to a worthy person, that gift is held to be Sattwic.

THE YOGA OF THE DIVISION OF THE THREEFOLD FAITH
Yattu pratyupakaaraartham phalamuddishya vaa punah;
Deeyate cha pariklishtam taddaanam raajasam smritam.
21. And, that gift which is made with a view to receive something in return, or looking for a
reward, or given reluctantly, is said to be Rajasic.
Adeshakaale yaddaanamapaatrebhyashcha deeyate;
Asatkritamavajnaatam tattaamasamudaahritam.
