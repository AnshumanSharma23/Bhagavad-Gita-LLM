Dhritarashtra married Gandhari, and Pandu was
married to Kunti and Madri. King Pandu was cursed for a sin while hunting, due to which he was
not permitted to unite with his wife. Kunti got a boon through her sincere service of a wise sage in
her younger age, and she begot three children, namely, Yudhisthira, Bhima and Arjuna from Yama,
Vayu and Indra respectively. Madri had twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, through the celestial
physicians called Asvini-Devatas. Dhritarashtra had a hundred and one children by his wife
Gandhari. Pandu passed away and his sons, the Pandavas, were all brought up by Dhritarashtra
along with his sons known as Kauravas. The Pandavas and Kauravas grew up together, but due to
the braveness and intelligence of the former, the Kauravas were unable to tolerate them.
