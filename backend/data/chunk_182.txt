O Arjuna, neither in this world, nor in the next world is there destruction for him; none,
verily, who does good, O My son, ever comes to grief!
Praapya punyakritaam lokaanushitwaa shaashwateeh samaah;
Shucheenaam shreemataam gehe yogabhrashto’bhijaayate.
41. Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and, having dwelt there for everlasting
years, he who fell from Yoga is reborn in the house of the pure and wealthy.
Athavaa yoginaameva kule bhavati dheemataam;
Etaddhi durlabhataram loke janma yadeedrisham.

THE YOGA OF MEDITATION
42. Or he is born in a family of even the wise Yogis; verily a birth like this is very difficult to
obtain in this world.
Tatra tam buddhisamyogam labhate paurvadehikam;
Yatate cha tato bhooyah samsiddhau kurunandana.
43. There he comes in touch with the knowledge acquired in his former body and strives
more than before for perfection, O Arjuna!
Poorvaabhyaasena tenaiva hriyate hyavasho’pi sah;
Jijnaasurapi yogasya shabdabrahmaativartate.
44.
