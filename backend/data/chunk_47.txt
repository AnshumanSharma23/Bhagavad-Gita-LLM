King Dhritarashtra, due to his attachment to his sons,
failed to control them, and the Kaurava chief, Duryodhana, with vain hope, decided to meet the
powerful Pandavas in war.
When both sides were prepared to commence the battle, the sage Veda Vyasa approached
blind Dhritarashtra and said, “If you wish to see this terrible carnage with your own eyes I can give
you the gift of vision.” The Kaurava king replied, “O Chief of the Brahmarishis! I have no desire to
see with my own eyes this slaughter of my family, but I should like to hear all the details of the
battle.”
Then the sage conferred the gift of divine vision on Sanjaya, the trusty counsellor of the
king, and told the king, “Sanjaya will describe to you all the incidents of the war. Whatever happens
in the course of the war, he will directly see, hear or otherwise come to know.
