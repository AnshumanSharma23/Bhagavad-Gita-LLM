The Lord gives instructions
according to the aspirantâ€™s qualification. Advaita philosophy can be grasped only by a microscopic
few. So, He speaks of other philosophical doctrines in different places to suit different kinds of
aspirants. From the absolute point of view there is neither the individual soul nor Self-realisation;
Brahman alone exists. Dualism, qualified monism and pure monism are different rungs in the
ladder of realisation. The truth is that the individual soul and Brahman are one in essence. All these
schools eventually reach the Advaitic goal of oneness. Understand things in their proper light.

Epilogue
India is held in high esteem by the Westerners on account of the Gita. Gandhiji once visited
one of the biggest libraries in London and asked the librarian which book was issued most
frequently. The librarian said that it was the Gita. It is very popular throughout the world. All
aspirants should try to get the whole eighteen discourses by heart.
