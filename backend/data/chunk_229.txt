Again, O mighty-armed Arjuna, listen to My supreme word which I shall declare to thee
who art beloved, for thy welfare!
COMMENTARY: The all-compassionate Lord in His mercy wants to encourage Arjuna
and cheer him up, and so He Himself comes forward to give him instructions without any request
having been made by Arjuna.
Na me viduh suraganaah prabhavam na maharshayah;
Ahamaadirhi devaanaam maharsheenaam cha sarvashah.
2. Neither the hosts of the gods nor the great sages know My origin; for, in every way I am
the source of all the gods and the great sages.
Yo maamajamanaadim cha vetti lokamaheshwaram;
Asammoodhah sa martyeshu sarvapaapaih pramuchyate.
3. He who knows Me as unborn and beginningless, as the great Lord of the worlds, he,
among mortals, is undeluded; he is liberated from all sins.
COMMENTARY: As the Supreme Being is the cause of all the worlds, He is
beginningless. As He is the source of all the gods and the great sages, so there is no source for His
own existence.
