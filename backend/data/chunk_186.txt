Among many thousands of
human beings, very few aspire for this union, and even among those who aspire for it, few ever
reach the pinnacle of spiritual realisation.
The Lord has already given a clear description of the all-pervading static and infinite state of
His. Now He proceeds to explain His manifestations as the universe and the power behind it. He
speaks of these manifestations as His lower and higher Prakritis. The lower Prakriti is made up of
the five elements, mind, ego and intellect. The higher Prakriti is the life-element which upholds the
universe, activates it and causes its appearance and final dissolution.
Krishna says that whatever exists is nothing but Himself. He is the cause of the appearance
of the universe and all things in it. Everything is strung on Him like clusters of gems on a string. He
is the essence, substance and substratum of everything, whether visible or invisible. Although
everything is in Him, yet He transcends everything as the actionless Self.
