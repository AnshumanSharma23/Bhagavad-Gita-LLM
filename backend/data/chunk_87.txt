Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha! It does not befit thee. Cast off this mean
weakness of the heart. Stand up, O scorcher of foes!
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Katham bheeshmamaham sankhye dronam cha madhusoodana;
Ishubhih pratiyotsyaami poojaarhaavarisoodana.
Arjuna said:
4. How, O Madhusudana, shall I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona,
who are fit to be worshipped, O destroyer of enemies?
Guroon ahatwaa hi mahaanubhaavaan
Shreyo bhoktum bhaikshyam apeeha loke;
Hatwaarthakaamaamstu guroon ihaiva
Bhunjeeya bhogaan rudhirapradigdhaan.
5. Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if
I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and desires will be stained with (their)
blood.
Na chaitad vidmah kataran no gareeyo
Yadwaa jayema yadi vaa no jayeyuh;
Yaan eva hatwaa na jijeevishaamas
Teâ€™vasthitaah pramukhe dhaartaraashtraah.
6. I can hardly tell which will be better: that we should conquer them or they should conquer
us.
