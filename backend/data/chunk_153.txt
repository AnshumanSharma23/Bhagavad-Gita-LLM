Actually there
is no real difference between the two.
Krishna further asserts that perfection can be attained and one can be established in the
Atman only after the mind has been purified through the performance of selfless action. The Karma
Yogi who is aware of the Atman and who is constantly engaged in action knows that although the
intellect, mind and senses are active, he does not do anything. He is a spectator of everything. He
dedicates all his actions to the Lord and thus abandons attachment, ever remaining pure and
unaffected. He surrenders himself completely to the Divine Shakti. Having completely rooted out
all desires, attachments and the ego, he is not born again.
The sage who has realised Brahman and is always absorbed in It does not have any rebirth.
Such a sage sees Brahman within and without—within as the static and transcendent Brahman, and
without as the entire universe. He sees the one Self in all beings and creatures—in a cow, an
elephant, and even in a dog and an outcaste.
