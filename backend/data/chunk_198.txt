All beings, including even the gods, come again and again
into this created universe from the state of unmanifest being wherein they remained at the end of an
age-cycle. But the Lord exists even beyond this unmanifest being. That radiant, imperishable
Divine Reality is the highest goal to be attained. Single-minded devotion of our heart is the means
of attaining this highest blessed state.
Even though there are auspicious and inauspicious circumstances of departing from the
physical body and journeying forth, yet if one steadily abides in the Lord through firm devotion and
faith, then these conditions do not matter. By always remaining in tune with the Lord through pure
love, everything is made auspicious, if one can ever remain united with the Divine through deep
devotion, constant remembrance, regular meditation and continuous communion, then all times,
places, conditions and situations become auspicious and blessed.
