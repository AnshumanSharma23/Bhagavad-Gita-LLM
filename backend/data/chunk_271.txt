Having restrained all the senses, even-minded everywhere, intent on the welfare of all
beings—verily they also come unto Me.
Klesho’dhikatarasteshaam avyaktaasaktachetasaam;
Avyaktaa hi gatirduhkham dehavadbhiravaapyate.
5. Greater is their trouble whose minds are set on the Unmanifested; for the goal—the
Unmanifested—is very difficult for the embodied to reach.

THE YOGA OF DEVOTION
COMMENTARY: The embodied—those who identify themselves with their bodies. The
imperishable Self is very hard to reach for those who are attached to their bodies. Their restless
minds will not be able to get fixed on the attributeless Self.
Ye tu sarvaani karmaani mayi sannyasya matparaah;
Ananyenaiva yogena maam dhyaayanta upaasate.
6. But to those who worship Me, renouncing all actions in Me, regarding Me as the supreme
goal, meditating on Me with single-minded Yoga,
Teshaamaham samuddhartaa mrityusamsaarasaagaraat;
Bhavaami nachiraat paartha mayyaaveshitachetasaam.
