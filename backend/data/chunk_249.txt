THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
14. Then, Arjuna, filled with wonder and with hair standing on end, bowed down his head to
the Lord and spoke with joined palms.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Pashyaami devaamstava deva dehe
Sarvaamstathaa bhootavisheshasanghaan;
Brahmaanameesham kamalaasanastha-
Mrisheemshcha sarvaanuragaamshcha divyaan.
Arjuna said:
15. I behold all the gods, O God, in Thy body, and hosts of various classes of beings;
Brahma, the Lord, seated on the lotus, all the sages and the celestial serpents!
Anekabaahoodaravaktranetram
Pashyaami twaam sarvatoâ€™nantaroopam;
Naantam na madhyam na punastavaadim
Pashyaami vishweshwara vishwaroopa.
