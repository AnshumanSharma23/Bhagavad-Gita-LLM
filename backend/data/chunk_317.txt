There are two types of beings in this world—the divine and the demoniacal; the divine
has been described at length; hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the demoniacal!
Pravrittim cha nivrittim cha janaa na viduraasuraah;
Na shaucham naapi chaachaaro na satyam teshu vidyate.
7. The demoniacal know not what to do and what to refrain from; neither purity nor right
conduct nor truth is found in them.
Asatyamapratishtham te jagadaahuraneeshwaram;
Aparasparasambhootam kimanyat kaamahaitukam.
8. They say: “This universe is without truth, without a (moral) basis, without a God, brought
about by mutual union, with lust for its cause; what else?”

THE YOGA OF THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE DIVINE AND THE DEMONIACAL
Etaam drishtimavashtabhya nashtaatmaano’lpabuddhayah;
Prabhavantyugrakarmaanah kshayaaya jagato’hitaah.
