Purity, good conduct and truth are indispensable to
spiritual progress and even to an honourable life here.
Devoid of purity, good conduct and truth, and having no faith in God or a higher Reality
beyond this visible world, man degenerates into a two-legged beast of ugly character and cruel
actions, and sinks into darkness. Such a person becomes his own enemy and the destroyer of the
happiness of others as well as his own. Caught in countless desires and cravings, a slave of sensual
enjoyments and beset by a thousand cares, his life ultimately ends in misery and degradation.
Haughtiness, arrogance and egoism lead to this dire fate. Therefore, a wise person, desiring success,
must eradicate vice and cultivate virtue.
In this world three gates lead to hellâ€”the gates of passion, anger and greed. Released from
these three qualities one can succeed in attaining salvation and reaching the highest goal, namely
God. Thus the sacred scriptures teach wisely the right path of pure, virtuous living.
