O Bhagavad Gita, with which Partha was illumined by Lord Narayana Himself, and
which was composed within the Mahabharata by the ancient sage, Vyasa, O Divine Mother, the
destroyer of rebirth, the showerer of the nectar of Advaita, and consisting of eighteen
discoursesâ€”upon Thee, O Gita, O affectionate Mother, I meditate!
Namostu te vyaasa vishaalabuddhe phullaaravindaayatapatranetra;
Yena twayaa bhaaratatailapoornah prajwaalito jnaanamayah pradeepah.
2. Salutations unto thee, O Vyasa, of broad intellect and with eyes like the petals of a
full-blown lotus, by whom the lamp of knowledge, filled with the oil of the Mahabharata, has been
lighted!
Prapannapaarijaataaya totravetraikapaanaye;
Jnaanamudraaya krishnaaya geetaamritaduhe namah.
