Now behold, O Arjuna, in this, My body, the whole universe centred in the
one—including the moving and the unmoving—and whatever else thou desirest to see!

BHAGAVAD GITA
Na tu maam shakyase drashtum anenaiva swachakshushaa;
Divyam dadaami te chakshuh pashya me yogamaishwaram.
8. But thou art not able to behold Me with these, thine own eyes; I give thee the divine eye;
behold My lordly Yoga.
COMMENTARY: No fleshy eye can behold Me in My Cosmic Form. One can see Me
only through the eye of intuition or the divine eye. It should not be confused with seeing through the
physical eye or through the mind. It is an inner divine experience attained through intense devotion
and concentration.
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Evamuktwaa tato raajan mahaayogeshwaro harih;
Darshayaamaasa paarthaaya paramam roopamaishwaram.
