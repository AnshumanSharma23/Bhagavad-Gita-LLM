The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge
(obtained through the study of scriptures); he is also superior to men of action; therefore, be thou a
Yogi, O Arjuna!
Yoginaamapi sarveshaam madgatenaantaraatmanaa;
Shraddhaavaan bhajate yo maam sa me yuktatamo matah.
