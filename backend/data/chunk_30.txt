He slays not nor
is He slain”—II.19; “Therefore, stand up and obtain fame. Conquer the enemies and enjoy the
unrivalled kingdom. Verily by Me have they been already slain; be thou a mere instrument, O
Arjuna!”—XI.33; “He who is free from the egoistic notion, whose intellect is untainted (by good or
evil), though he slays these people, he slayeth not, nor is he bound (by the action)”—XVIII.17.
Just as coloured dye stands out more clearly only when the original material is pure white,
so also the instructions of a sage penetrate and settle down only in the hearts of aspirants whose
minds are calm, who have no desire for enjoyments and whose impurities have been destroyed. For
this reason an aspirant is expected to possess the qualifications of keen discrimination, dispassion,
control of the mind and senses, and aversion to worldly attractions, before he can practise the
threefold Sadhana of hearing the scriptures, reflecting upon them, and meditating upon their
significance.
