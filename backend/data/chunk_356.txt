Dwelling in solitude, eating but little, with speech, body and mind subdued, always
engaged in concentration and meditation, taking refuge in dispassion,
Ahankaaram balam darpam kaamam krodham parigraham;
Vimuchya nirmamah shaanto brahmabhooyaaya kalpate.
53. Having abandoned egoism, strength, arrogance, anger, desire, and covetousness, free
from the notion of “mine” and peaceful,—he is fit for becoming Brahman.
Brahmabhootah prasannaatmaa na shochati na kaangkshati;
Samah sarveshu bhooteshu madbhaktim labhate paraam.
54. Becoming Brahman, serene in the Self, he neither grieves nor desires; the same to all
beings, he attains supreme devotion unto Me.
Bhaktyaa maamabhijaanaati yaavaanyashchaasmi tattwatah;
Tato maam tattwato jnaatwaa vishate tadanantaram.
