The Lord
accepts such worship, knowing that it is directed to Him only.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Mayyaasaktamanaah paartha yogam yunjanmadaashrayah;
Asamshayam samagram maam yathaa jnaasyasi tacchrinu.

THE YOGA OF MEDITATION
The Blessed Lord said:
1. O Arjuna, hear how you shall without doubt know Me fully, with the mind intent on Me,
practising Yoga and taking refuge in Me!
COMMENTARY: If you sing the glories and attributes of the Lord, you will develop love
for Him and then your mind will be ever fixed on Him. Intense love for the Lord is real devotion.
With this you must surely get full knowledge of the Self.
Jnaanam te’ham savijnaanam idam vakshyaamyasheshatah;
Yajjnaatwaa neha bhooyo’nyaj jnaatavyamavashishyate.
2. I shall declare to thee in full this knowledge combined with direct realisation, after
knowing which nothing more here remains to be known.
Manushyaanaam sahasreshu kashchidyatati siddhaye;
Yatataamapi siddhaanaam kashchinmaam vetti tattwatah.
