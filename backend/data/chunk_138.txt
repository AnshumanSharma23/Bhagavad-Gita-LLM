Whenever there is a decline of righteousness, O Arjuna, and rise of unrighteousness, then
I manifest Myself!
COMMENTARY: That which elevates a man and helps him to reach the goal of life and
attain knowledge is Dharma (righteousness); that which drags him into worldliness is
unrighteousness. That which helps a man to attain liberation is Dharma; that which makes him
irreligious is Adharma or unrighteousness.
Paritraanaaya saadhoonaam vinaashaaya cha dushkritaam;
Dharma samsthaapanaarthaaya sambhavaami yuge yuge.
8. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment
of righteousness, I am born in every age.
Janma karma cha me divyam evam yo vetti tattwatah;
Tyaktwa deham punarjanma naiti maameti soâ€™rjuna.
