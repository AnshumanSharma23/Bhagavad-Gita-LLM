When a man completely casts off, O Arjuna, all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in
the Self by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady wisdom!
COMMENTARY: All the pleasures of the world are worthless to an illumined sage who is
ever content in the immortal Self.

Veetaraagabhayakrodhah sthitadheer munir uchyate.

Yah sarvatraanabhisnehas tattat praapya shubhaashubham;
Naabhinandati na dweshti tasya prajnaa pratishthitaa.
57. He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything good or bad, who
neither rejoices nor hates, his wisdom is fixed.
