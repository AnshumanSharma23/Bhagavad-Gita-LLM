Little by little let him attain to quietude by the intellect held firmly; having made the
mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything.
Yato yato nishcharati manashchanchalamasthiram;
Tatastato niyamyaitad aatmanyeva vasham nayet.
26. From whatever cause the restless, unsteady mind wanders away, from that let him
restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.
Prashaantamanasam hyenam yoginam sukhamuttamam;
Upaiti shaantarajasam brahmabhootamakalmasham.
27. Supreme bliss verily comes to this Yogi whose mind is quite peaceful, whose passion is
quieted, who has become Brahman, and who is free from sin.
Yunjannevam sadaaâ€™tmaanam yogee vigatakalmashah;
Sukhena brahmasamsparsham atyantam sukham ashnute.
28. The Yogi, always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of Yoga), freed from sins,
easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with Brahman (the Eternal).
Sarvabhootasthamaatmaanam sarvabhootaani chaatmani;
Eekshate yogayuktaatmaa sarvatra samadarshanah.
