Of them, the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels (is the best); for, I am
exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me.
Udaaraah sarva evaite jnaanee twaatmaiva me matam;
Aasthitah sa hi yuktaatmaa maamevaanuttamaam gatim.
18. Noble indeed are all these; but I deem the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in
mind, he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.
Bahoonaam janmanaamante jnaanavaanmaam prapadyate;
Vaasudevah sarvamiti sa mahaatmaa sudurlabhah.
19. At the end of many births the wise man comes to Me, realising that all this is Vasudeva
(the innermost Self); such a great soul (Mahatma) is very hard to find.
Kaamaistaistairhritajnaanaah prapadyanteâ€™nyadevataah;
Tam tam niyamamaasthaaya prakrityaa niyataah swayaa.
20.
