Such ignorant people say: “There is no intimate connection between the
verses. They are thrown in a disorderly manner. There is a great deal of repetition.” If they study the
book with reverence and faith under a qualified teacher all their doubts would vanish. They will

and the Upanishads are useful repetitions. They are best calculated to create a deep and indelible
impression in the mind of the aspirant.

verses.
In the Kathopanishad the term “brick” is used to denote the gods. In the Hatha Yogic texts it
is stated: “At the junction of the rivers Yamuna and Ganga there is a young virgin”.
