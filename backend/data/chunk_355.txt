He whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has subdued his self, from whom
desire has fled,â€”he by renunciation attains the supreme state of freedom from action.
Siddhim praapto yathaa brahma tathaapnoti nibodha me;
Samaasenaiva kaunteya nishthaa jnaanasya yaa paraa.
50. Learn from Me in brief, O Arjuna, how he who has attained perfection reaches
Brahman, that supreme state of knowledge.
Buddhyaa vishuddhayaa yukto dhrityaatmaanam niyamya cha;
Shabdaadeen vishayaanstyaktwaa raagadweshau vyudasya cha.
51. Endowed with a pure intellect, controlling the self by firmness, relinquishing sound and
other objects and abandoning both hatred and attraction,
Viviktasevee laghwaashee yatavaakkaayamaanasah;
Dhyaanayogaparo nityam vairaagyam samupaashritah.
52.
