Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou
shouldst act here in this world.
Hari Om Tat Sat
Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam
Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade
Daivaasurasampadvibhaagayogo Naama Shodasho’dhyaayah
Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the sixteenth discourse
entitled:
“The Yoga of the Division Between the Divine & the Demoniacal”
XVII
THE YOGA OF THE DIVISION OF THE THREEFOLD FAITH
Summary of Seventeenth Discourse
This discourse is termed the “Yoga of the Division of the Three Kinds of Faith”. The theme
of this discourse arises out of the question asked by Arjuna in Verse 1 with reference to the final and
closing advice of Lord Krishna in the previous discourse, contained in the last two verses therein
(Verses 23 and 24).
