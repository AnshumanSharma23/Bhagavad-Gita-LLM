By devotion he knows Me in truth, what and who I am; and knowing Me in truth, he
forthwith enters into the Supreme.
Sarvakarmaanyapi sadaa kurvaano madvyapaashrayah;
Matprasaadaadavaapnoti shaashwatam padamavyayam.
56. Doing all actions always, taking refuge in Me, by My Grace he obtains the eternal,
indestructible state or abode.
Chetasaa sarvakarmaani mayi sannyasya matparah;
Buddhiyogam upaashritya macchittah satatam bhava.
57. Mentally renouncing all actions in Me, having Me as the highest goal, resorting to the
Yoga of discrimination do thou ever fix thy mind on Me.
Macchittah sarvadurgaani matprasaadaat tarishyasi;
Atha chet twam ahankaaraan na shroshyasi vinangkshyasi.
58. Fixing thy mind on Me, thou shalt by My Grace overcome all obstacles; but if from
egoism thou wilt not hear Me, thou shalt perish.
Yadahankaaram aashritya na yotsya iti manyase;
Mithyaisha vyavasaayaste prakritistwaam niyokshyati.
