He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees equality everywhere, be it
pleasure or pain, he is regarded as the highest Yogi!
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Yoâ€™yam yogastwayaa proktah saamyena madhusoodana;
Etasyaaham na pashyaami chanchalatwaat sthitim sthiraam.
Arjuna said:
33. This Yoga of equanimity taught by Thee, O Krishna, I do not see its steady continuance,
because of restlessness (of the mind)!
Chanchalam hi manah krishna pramaathi balavad dridham;
Tasyaaham nigraham manye vaayoriva sudushkaram.
34. The mind verily is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding, O Krishna! I deem it as
difficult to control as to control the wind.
COMMENTARY: The mind ever changes its point of concentration from one object to
another. So it is always restless. It is not only restless but also turbulent and impetuous, strong and
obstinate. It produces agitation in the body and in the senses.
