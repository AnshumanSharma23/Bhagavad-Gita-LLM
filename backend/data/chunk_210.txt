26. The bright and the dark paths of the world are verily thought to be eternal; by the one
(the bright path) a person goes not to return again, and by the other (the dark path) he returns.
COMMENTARY: The bright path is the path to the gods taken by devotees. The dark path
is of the manes taken by those who perform sacrifices or charitable acts with the expectation of
rewards.
