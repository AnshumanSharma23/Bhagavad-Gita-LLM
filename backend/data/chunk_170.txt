Let a man lift himself by his own Self alone; let him not lower himself, for this self alone
is the friend of oneself and this self alone is the enemy of oneself.
Bandhuraatmaaâ€™tmanastasya yenaatmaivaatmanaa jitah;
Anaatmanastu shatrutwe vartetaatmaiva shatruvat.
6. The self is the friend of the self for him who has conquered himself by the Self, but to the
unconquered self, this self stands in the position of an enemy like the (external) foe.
Jitaatmanah prashaantasya paramaatmaa samaahitah;
Sheetoshna sukha duhkheshu tathaa maanaapamaanayoh.
7. The Supreme Self of him who is self-controlled and peaceful is balanced in cold and heat,
pleasure and pain, as also in honour and dishonour.
Jnaana vijnaana triptaatmaa kootastho vijitendriyah;
Yuktah ityuchyate yogee samaloshtaashmakaanchanah.
