The goal
of science is to discover the one ultimate Truth which is the substratum of the atoms, molecules,
electrons, energy, motion and all physical and mental phenomena and laws of Nature by means of
enquiry, observation, analysis, investigation and study of these laws in operation. A Vedantin is the
real scientist. Only his mode of approach to the Truth is different.
The scientist who in the past proclaimed that there was nothing beyond this world now
proclaims: “The more I know of phenomena, the more I am puzzled. Intellect is finite and cold.
Behind these changing phenomena there is the unchanging noumenon. Behind the dynamic
rotating electrons, there is the static, motionless something, or something beyond the intellect and
the world”.

Reconciliation of the Paths
In the Vishnu Purana, Bhagavan Vishnu is highly eulogised and a secondary place is given
to Lord Shiva. In the Shiva Purana, Lord Shiva is immensely praised whilst Lord Vishnu is
secondary.
