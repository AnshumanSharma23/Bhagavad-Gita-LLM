I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers
Me (for a long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single or one-pointed mind), O Partha
(Arjuna)!
COMMENTARY: Constantly remembering the Lord throughout one’s life is the easiest
way of attaining Him.
Maamupetya punarjanma duhkhaalayamashaashwatam;
Naapnuvanti mahaatmaanah samsiddhim paramaam gataah.

THE YOGA OF THE IMPERISHABLE BRAHMAN
15. Having attained Me these great souls do not again take birth (here), which is the place of
pain and is non-eternal; they have reached the highest perfection (liberation).
Aabrahmabhuvanaallokaah punaraavartino’rjuna;
Maamupetya tu kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate.
16. (All) the worlds, including the world of Brahma, are subject to return again, O Arjuna!
But he who reaches Me, O son of Kunti, has no rebirth!
Sahasrayugaparyantam aharyad brahmano viduh;
Raatrim yugasahasraantaam te’horaatravido janaah.
