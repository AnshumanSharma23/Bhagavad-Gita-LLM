If all the Upanishads should represent cows, Sri Krishna is their milker. Arjuna is the calf
who first tasted that milk of wisdom of the Self, milked by the divine Cowherd for the benefit of all
humanity. This milk is the Bhagavad Gita. It solves not only Arjuna’s problems and doubts, but
also the world’s problems and those of every individual. Glory to Krishna, the friend of the
cowherds of Gokula, the joy of Devaki! He who drinks the nectar of the Gita through purification of
the heart and regular meditation, attains immortality, eternal bliss, everlasting peace and perennial
joy.
