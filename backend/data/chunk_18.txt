The esoteric
meaning of this is that there is the Sushumna Nadi between the Ida and the Pingala. So, without the
help of a Guru, you will not be able to understand the proper meaning of the verses of the Gita. You
will be like the man who brought a horse to one who asked for saindava while taking food. The
word saindava means salt as well as horse!

Harmony in the Gita
Man is a composite of three fundamental factors, namely, will, feeling and cognition. There
are three kinds of temperament—the active, the emotional and the rational. Even so, there are three
Yogas—Jnana Yoga for a person of enquiry and rational temperament, Bhakti Yoga for the
emotional temperament, and Karma Yoga for a person of action. One Yoga is as efficacious as the
other.
The Bhagavad Gita formulates the theories of the three paths without creating any conflict
among them. It harmonises most wonderfully the philosophy of action, devotion and knowledge.
All three must be harmoniously blended if you wish to attain perfection.
