Krishna asked Arjuna to
fulfil his desire by selecting Him unarmed or His powerful army called Narayani Sena. Arjuna, who
was a devotee of Sri Krishna, expressed his desire to have the Lord with him, neglecting the
powerful Narayani Sena, even though Krishna warned that He would remain a witness, bound by
the vow of not participating in battle and not taking up arms. Duryodhana, with great delight,
thinking that Arjuna was foolish, expressed his wish for the powerful army to help his side in the
battle.
When Krishna asked Arjuna why he chose Him when He was not for taking up arms, Arjuna
said, â€œO Lord! You have the power to destroy all the forces by a mere sight. Why then should I
prefer that worthless army? I have for a long time been cherishing a desire in my heart that you
should act as my charioteer.
