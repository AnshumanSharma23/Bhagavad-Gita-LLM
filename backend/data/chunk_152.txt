Therefore, with the sword of knowledge (of the Self) cut asunder the doubt of the self
born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, and take refuge in Yoga; arise, O Arjuna!

Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the fourth discourse entitled:
“The Yoga of Wisdom”
V
THE YOGA OF RENUNCIATION OF ACTION
Summary of Fifth Discourse
In spite of Sri Krishna’s clear instructions, Arjuna still seems to be bewildered. He wants to
know conclusively which is superior, the path of action or the path of renunciation of action.
The Lord says that both the paths lead to the highest goal of God-realisation. In both cases
the final realisation of the Atman is the aim, but the path of Karma Yoga is superior.
