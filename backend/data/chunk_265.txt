Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Krishna again showed His own form; and the great soul
(Krishna), assuming His gentle form, consoled him who was terrified (Arjuna).
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Drishtwedam maanusham roopam tava saumyam janaardana;
Idaaneemasmi samvrittah sachetaah prakritim gatah.
Arjuna said:
51. Having seen this Thy gentle human form, O Krishna, now I am composed and restored
to my own nature!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Sudurdarshamidam roopam drishtavaanasi yanmama;
Devaa apyasya roopasya nityam darshanakaangkshinah.
The Blessed Lord said:
52. Very hard indeed it is to see this form of Mine which thou hast seen. Even the gods are
ever longing to behold it.
Naa ham vedairna tapasaa na daanena na chejyayaa;
Shakya evamvidho drashtum drishtavaanasi maam yathaa.
