Know thou that Nature and Spirit are beginningless; and know also that all
modifications and qualities are born of Nature.
Kaaryakaaranakartrutwe hetuh prakritiruchyate;
Purushah sukhaduhkhaanaam bhoktritwe heturuchyate.
21. In the production of the effect and the cause, Nature (matter) is said to be the cause; in
the experience of pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the cause.
Purushah prakritistho hi bhungkte prakritijaan gunaan;
Kaaranam gunasango’sya sadasadyoni janmasu.
22. The soul seated in Nature experiences the qualities born of Nature; attachment to the
qualities is the cause of his birth in good and evil wombs.
Upadrashtaanumantaa cha bhartaa bhoktaa maheshwarah;
Paramaatmeti chaapyukto dehe’smin purushah parah.
23. The Supreme Soul in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter,
the enjoyer, the great Lord and the Supreme Self.
Ya evam vetti purusham prakritim cha gunaih saha;
Sarvathaa vartamaano’pi na sa bhooyo’bhijaayate.
