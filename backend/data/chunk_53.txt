Meet me quickly, O Prabhu! I am pining, I
am melting. Listen, listen, listen to my fervent, innermost prayer. Do not be cruel, my Lord. Thou
art the friend of the afflicted. Thou art one who raises the downtrodden. Thou art the purifier of the
fallen.
O magnificent Lord of love and compassion! O fountain-head of bliss and knowledge! Thou
art the eye of our eye, the ear of our ear, the breath of our breath, the mind of our mind, the soul of
our soul. Thou art the unseen seer, the unthought thinker, the unheard hearer, the unknown knower.
Pray, deliver us from temptation. Give us light, knowledge and purity.
O Lord of my breath! O all-pervading Lord of the universe, accept my humble prayer!
Guide me. Lift me from the mire of worldliness. Enlighten me. Protect me.
