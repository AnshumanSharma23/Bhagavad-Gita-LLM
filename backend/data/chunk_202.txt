Brahman is the Imperishable, the Supreme; His essential nature is called Self-knowledge;
the offering (to the gods) which causes existence and manifestation of beings and which also
sustains them is called action.
Adhibhootam ksharo bhaavah purushashchaadhidaivatam;
Adhiyajnoâ€™hamevaatra dehe dehabhritaam vara.
4. Adhibhuta (knowledge of the elements) pertains to My perishable Nature, and the
Purusha or soul is the Adhidaiva; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best among the
embodied (men)!
Antakaale cha maameva smaran muktwaa kalevaram;
Yah prayaati sa madbhaavam yaati naastyatra samshayah.
5. And whosoever, leaving the body, goes forth remembering Me alone at the time of death,
he attains My Being; there is no doubt about this.
Yam yam vaapi smaran bhaavam tyajatyante kalevaram;
Tam tamevaiti kaunteya sadaa tadbhaavabhaavitah.
