I see Thee of boundless form on every side, with many arms, stomachs, mouths and
eyes; neither the end nor the middle nor also the beginning do I see, O Lord of the universe, O
Cosmic Form!
Kireetinam gadinam chakrinam cha,
Tejoraashim sarvato deeptimantam;
Pashyaami twaam durnireekshyam samantaad
Deeptaanalaarkadyutimaprameyam.
17. I see Thee with the diadem, the club and the discus, a mass of radiance shining
everywhere, very hard to look at, blazing all round like burning fire and the sun, and immeasurable.
Twamaksharam paramam veditavyam
Twamasya vishwasya param nidhaanam;
Twamavyayah shaashwatadharmagoptaa
Sanaatanastwam purusho mato me.
