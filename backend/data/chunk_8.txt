A considerable volume of material has been compressed within these verses. On the
battlefield of Kurukshetra, Sri Krishna, during the course of His most instructive and interesting
talk with Arjuna, revealed profound, sublime and soul-stirring spiritual truths, and expounded the
rare secrets of Yoga, Vedanta, Bhakti and Karma.
All the teachings of Lord Krishna were subsequently recorded as the Song Celestial or
Srimad Bhagavad Gita by Bhagavan Vyasa for the benefit of humanity at large. The world is under
a great debt of gratitude to Bhagavan Vyasa who presented this Song Celestial to humanity for the
guidance of their daily conduct of life, spiritual upliftment and Self-realisation.
