My limbs fail and my mouth is parched up, my body quivers and my hairs stand on end!
Gaandeevam sramsate hastaat twak chaiva paridahyate;
Na cha shaknomyavasthaatum bhramateeva cha me manah.
30. The (bow) “Gandiva” slips from my hand and my skin burns all over; I am unable even
to stand, my mind is reeling, as it were.
Nimittaani cha pashyaami vipareetaani keshava;
Na cha shreyo’nupashyaami hatwaa swajanam aahave.
31. And I see adverse omens, O Kesava! I do not see any good in killing my kinsmen in
battle.

BHAGAVAD GITA
Na kaangkshe vijayam krishna na cha raajyam sukhaani cha;
Kim no raajyena govinda kim bhogair jeevitena vaa.
32. For I desire neither victory, O Krishna, nor pleasures nor kingdoms! Of what avail is a
dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life?
Yeshaam arthe kaangkshitam no raajyam bhogaah sukhaani cha;
Ta ime’vasthitaa yuddhe praanaamstyaktwaa dhanaani cha.
33.
