You should have the head
of Sri Shankara, the heart of Lord Buddha and the hand of King Janaka. The three horses of this
body-chariot—action, emotion and intellect—should work in perfect harmony. Only then will it
move smoothly and reach the destination safely and quickly. Only then can you rejoice in the Self,
sing the song of Soham, be in tune with the Infinite, hear the soundless voice of the Soul and enjoy
the sweet music of the eternal Self.
The central teaching of the Gita is the attainment of the final beatitude of life—perfection or
eternal freedom. This may be achieved by doing one’s prescribed duties of life. Lord Krishna says
to Arjuna: “Therefore, without attachment, constantly perform action which is duty, for, by
performing action without attachment, man verily reaches the Supreme”.
The Gita is divided into three sections, illustrative of the three terms of the Mahavakya of
the Sama Veda—“Tat Twam Asi—That Thou Art”.
