Serene-minded, fearless, firm in the vow of a Brahmachari, having controlled the mind,
thinking of Me and balanced in mind, let him sit, having Me as his supreme goal.
Yunjannevam sadaa’tmaanam yogee niyatamaanasah;
Shaantim nirvaanaparamaam matsamsthaamadhigacchati.
15. Thus, always keeping the mind balanced, the Yogi, with the mind controlled, attains to
the peace abiding in Me, which culminates in liberation.
Naatyashnatastu yogo’sti nachaikaantamanashnatah;
Na chaatiswapnasheelasya jaagrato naiva chaarjuna.
16. Verily Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at
all; nor for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who is (always) awake, O Arjuna!
Yuktaahaaravihaarasya yuktacheshtasya karmasu;

THE YOGA OF MEDITATION
Yuktaswapnaavabodhasya yogo bhavati duhkhahaa.
