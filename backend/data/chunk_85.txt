Krishna advises Arjuna to fight, free
from desire for acquisition of kingdom or preservation of it.
Arjuna is eager to know the characteristics of a man who has a stable mind. Such a person,
Krishna tells him, will have no desires at all. Since he is content within, having realised the Self, he
is entirely free from desires. The consciousness of the Atman and abandonment of desires are
simultaneous experiences. The various qualities of a Sthitaprajna (a stable-minded person) are
described by the Lord. He will not be affected by adversity and will have no fear or anger. He will
take things as they come, and will not have any likes and dislikes. He will neither hug the world nor
hate it.
The man of stable mind will have perfect control of the senses. The senses are powerful and
draw the mind outwards. One should therefore turn oneâ€™s gaze within and realise God who resides
in the heart. The Yogi, having achieved a stable mind, remains steadfast even though all
sense-objects come to him.
