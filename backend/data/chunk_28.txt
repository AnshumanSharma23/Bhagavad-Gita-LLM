The former is a demoniacal attribute, the latter a divine one. Attachment is born of
ignorance, selfishness and passion and brings with it death; detachment is wisdom and brings with
it freedom. The practice of detachment is a rigorous discipline. You may stumble like a baby who is
just learning to walk, but you will have to rise up again with a cheerful heart. Failures are not
stumbling-blocks but steppingstones to success.
Try to dwell always in your own Self. Abide in your centre. Think of the Self constantly.
Then all attachments will die automatically. Attachment to the Lord is a potent antidote to
annihilate all worldly attachments. He who has no attachments can really love others, for his love is
pure and divine. “Therefore, without attachment do thou always perform action which should be
done; for, by performing action without attachment man reaches the Supreme”—III.19.

In Defence
Some people study the Gita in order to find loopholes and criticise the teachings contained
in it.
