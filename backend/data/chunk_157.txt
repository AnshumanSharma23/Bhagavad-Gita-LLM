He who is devoted to the path of action, whose mind is quite pure, who has conquered the
self, who has subdued his senses and who has realised his Self as the Self in all beings, though
acting, he is not tainted.
Naiva kinchit karomeeti yukto manyeta tattwavit;
Pashyan shrunvan sprishan jighran nashnan gacchan swapan shwasan.
8. “I do nothing at all”—thus will the harmonised knower of Truth think—seeing, hearing,
touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, breathing,
Pralapan visrijan grihnan nunmishan nimishannapi;
Indriyaaneendriyaartheshu vartanta iti dhaarayan.
9. Speaking, letting go, seizing, opening and closing the eyes—convinced that the senses
move among the sense-objects.
COMMENTARY: The liberated sage always remains as a witness of the activities of the
senses as he identifies himself with the Self.
Brahmanyaadhaaya karmaani sangam tyaktwaa karoti yah;
Lipyate na sa paapena padmapatram ivaambhasaa.
