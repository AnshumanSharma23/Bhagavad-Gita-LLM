Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence of pride—these belong
to one born in a divine state, O Arjuna!
Dambho darpo’bhimaanashcha krodhah paarushyameva cha;
Ajnaanam chaabhijaatasya paartha sampadamaasureem.
4. Hypocrisy, arrogance, self-conceit, harshness and also anger and ignorance, belong to
one who is born in a demoniacal state, O Arjuna!
Daivee sampadvimokshaaya nibandhaayaasuree mataa;
Maa shuchah sampadam daiveem abhijaato’si paandava.
5. The divine nature is deemed for liberation and the demoniacal for bondage. Grieve not, O
Arjuna, for thou art born with divine properties!
COMMENTARY: As Arjuna is dejected, Sri Krishna assures him not to feel alarmed at
this description of the demoniacal qualities as he is born with Sattwic tendencies leading towards
salvation.
Dwau bhootasargau loke’smin daiva aasura eva cha;
Daivo vistarashah proktah aasuram paartha me shrinu.
