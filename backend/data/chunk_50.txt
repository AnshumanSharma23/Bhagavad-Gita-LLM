To that Guru we prostrate.
Dhyaanamoolam gurormoortih poojaamoolam guroh padam;
Mantramoolam gurorvaakyam mokshamoolam guroh kripaa.
The Guru’s form is the root of meditation; the Guru’s feet are the root of worship; the
Guru’s word is the root of Mantra; the Guru’s Grace is the root of liberation.
PRAYER TO LORD KRISHNA
Krishnaaya vaasudevaaya devakeenandanaaya cha;
Nandagopakumaaraaya govindaaya namo namah.
I bow again and again to Lord Krishna, son of Vasudeva, the delighter of Devaki, the darling
of Nandagopa, the protector of cows.
O Krishna! Thou art my sweet companion now. Thou hast a soft corner for me in Thy heart.
Teach me now the mysteries of Thy divine play and the secrets of Vedanta. Thou sayest in the Gita:
“I am the author of Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas”. Thou art my best teacher. Explain to me
the intricate details of Vedanta.
