Having thus attained perfect union with the Self, the Yogi no more descends into ignorance or
delusion. He does not relish any more the pleasures of the senses.
Lord Krishna again emphasises that the concentration of the mind on the Atman should be
like a steady flame in a windless place. This ultimately leads to the vision of the Lord in all beings
and creatures. Arjuna is doubtful whether it is at all possible to engage the mind steadily on the
higher Self, as its very nature seems to be one of restlessness. Krishna assures him that the practice
can succeed through Vairagya (dispassion) and constant effort.
Arjuna wishes to know the fate of the aspirant who fails to realise the Supreme in spite of his
faith and sincerity. Krishna tells him that the accumulated power of his Yogic practices will assure
him a better birth in the future, with more favourable conditions for Sadhana.
