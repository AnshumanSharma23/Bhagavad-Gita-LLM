The Rajasic intellect is not able to distinguish between
righteous and unrighteous actions.
Adharmam dharmamiti yaa manyate tamasaavritaa;
Sarvaarthaan vipareetaamshcha buddhih saa paartha taamasee.
32. That which, enveloped in darkness, views Adharma as Dharma and all things
perverted—that intellect, O Arjuna, is called Tamasic!
Dhrityaa yayaa dhaarayate manah praanendriyakriyaah;
Yogenaavyabhichaarinyaa dhritih saa paartha saattwikee.
33. The unwavering firmness by which, through Yoga, the functions of the mind, the
life-force and the senses are restrained—that firmness, O Arjuna, is Sattwic!
