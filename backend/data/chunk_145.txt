Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter (ghee); by Brahman is the
oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees
Brahman in action.
COMMENTARY: This is wisdom-sacrifice, wherein the idea of Brahman is substituted
for the ideas of the instrument and other accessories of action, the idea of action itself and its results.
By having such an idea the whole action melts away.

Brahmaagnaavapare yajnam yajnenaivopajuhwati.
25. Some Yogis perform sacrifice to the gods alone, while others (who have realised the
Self) offer the Self as sacrifice by the Self in the fire of Brahman alone.
