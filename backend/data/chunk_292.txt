The second quality of Rajas gives rise to passion manifested by intense
attachment and greed. It causes sorrow and suffering. The third, termed Tamas, is the worst of all. It
arises due to ignorance and results in darkness, lethargy and delusion.
Krishna asks us to diligently endeavour to cast out Tamas from our nature. We should
control and master Rajas, and by holding it in check, wisely divert its power towards good kinds of
activities. Sattwa should be carefully cultivated, developed and conserved in order to enable us to
attain immortality. The realised sage, of course, goes beyond all these qualities, for, although it is
Sattwa that enables him to reach God, even this quality will bind him if he is attached to it.
The aspirant should know the symptoms and signs of their presence in his personality and
acquire a knowledge of their subtle workings. Then only can he maintain an unhampered and
smooth progress in all activities of his life, both secular as well as spiritual.
