In the Devi Bhagavatam, the Divine Mother is given prominence above Lord Shiva and
Lord Vishnu. All this is done in order to create in the aspirant intense and unswerving faith in his
favourite Deity. All Deities are one; they are different aspects of the Lord. It is simply absurd to
believe that Shiva is inferior to Vishnu, or vice versa.
In the same manner, in one place in the Gita, Lord Krishna praises Karma Yoga: “The Yoga
of action is superior to the renunciation of action”—V.2. In another place He praises Raja Yoga:
“The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge; he is also
superior to men of action. Therefore, be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna!”—VI.46. In yet another place Lord
Krishna praises the path of Bhakti Yoga: “The highest Purusha, O Arjuna, is attainable by
unswerving devotion to Him alone within whom all beings dwell and by whom all this is
pervaded!”—VIII.22.
