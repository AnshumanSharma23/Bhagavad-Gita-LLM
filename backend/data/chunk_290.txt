They who, through the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the Field and
its Knower, and also the liberation from the Nature of being, they go to the Supreme.
COMMENTARY: They who know through the eye of intuition opened by meditation and
the instructions of the Guru and the scriptures, that the Field is insentient, the doer, changing and
finite, and that the Knower of the Field is pure Consciousness, the non-doer, unchanging and
infinite, and who also perceive the non-existence of Nature, ignorance, the Unmanifested, the
material cause of being,—they attain the Supreme.
