The knowledge of these three Gunas, which hold the entire universe
and all creatures under their sway, is of vital importance to each and everyone for their progress and
happiness in life. Without this knowledge one will be forever bound by sorrow. In this knowledge
we have the secret of success in worldly life as well as in spiritual life. Therefore, one should
acquire this precious knowledge.
Lord Krishna reveals that these three qualities compose the Cosmic Nature. This Cosmic
Nature is the primal source and origin of the entire creation and all things in it. Hence all things
created are subject to their influence and irresistible power. The individual soul also is bound to the
body by these three qualities present in Cosmic Nature. The Supreme Being brings about creation
through the help of His Prakriti (Nature) endowed with these threefold qualities.

BHAGAVAD GITA
The highest of the three qualities is Sattwa. It is pure. It brings about happiness, wisdom and
also illumination.
