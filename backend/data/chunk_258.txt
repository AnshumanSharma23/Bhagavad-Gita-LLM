Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna and all the other courageous warriorsâ€”these have
already been slain by Me; do thou kill; be not distressed with fear; fight and thou shalt conquer thy
enemies in battle.

THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE COSMIC FORM
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Etacchrutwaa vachanam keshavasya
Kritaanjalirvepamaanah kireetee;
Namaskritwaa bhooya evaaha krishnam
Sagadgadam bheetabheetah pranamya.
Sanjaya said:
35. Having heard that speech of Lord Krishna, the crowned one (Arjuna), with joined palms,
trembling, prostrating himself, again addressed Krishna, in a choked voice, bowing down,
overwhelmed with fear.
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Sthaane hrisheekesha tava prakeertyaa
Jagat prahrishyatyanurajyate cha;
Rakshaamsi bheetaani disho dravanti
Sarve namasyanti cha siddhasanghaah.
Arjuna said:
36.
