So the sword
cannot cut It, fire cannot burn It, wind cannot dry It.
Acchedyo’yam adaahyo’yam akledyo’shoshya eva cha;
Nityah sarvagatah sthaanur achalo’yam sanaatanah.
24. This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable,
ancient and immovable.
Avyakto’yam achintyo’yam avikaaryo’yam uchyate;
Tasmaad evam viditwainam naanushochitum arhasi.
25. This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore,
knowing This to be such, thou shouldst not grieve.
Atha chainam nityajaatam nityam vaa manyase mritam;
Tathaapi twam mahaabaaho naivam shochitum arhasi.
26. But, even if thou thinkest of It as being constantly born and dying, even then, O
mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve!

BHAGAVAD GITA
COMMENTARY: Birth is inevitable to what is dead and death is inevitable to what is
born. This is the law of Nature.
