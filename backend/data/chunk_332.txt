The gift which is given at the wrong place and time to unworthy persons, without respect
or with insult, is declared to be Tamasic.
COMMENTARY: At the wrong place and time—at a place which is not holy, where
irreligious people and beggars assemble, where wealth acquired through illegal means such as
gambling and theft, is distributed to gamblers, singers, fools, rogues, women of evil reputation;
wealth that is distributed at an inauspicious time. This does not discourage the giving of alms to the
poor.
Om tatsaditi nirdesho brahmanas trividhah smritah;
Braahmanaastena vedaashcha yajnaashcha vihitaah puraa.
23. “Om Tat Sat”: this has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman. By that
were created formerly the Brahmanas, the Vedas and the sacrifices.
Tasmaadomityudaahritya yajnadaanatapahkriyaah;
Pravartante vidhaanoktaah satatam brahmavaadinaam.
