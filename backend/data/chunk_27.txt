In one place He praises Jnana Yoga: “Noble indeed are all these; but I deem
the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in mind, he is established in Me alone as the supreme
goal”—VII.18.
A beginner is confused when he comes across these seemingly contradictory verses. But, if
you think deeply, there is no room for any confusion. Krishna praises each Yoga in order to create
interest in the aspirant in his particular path. The Gita is a book for the people of the world at large.
It was not meant for Arjuna alone. Each Yoga is as efficacious as the other.
Essence of the Gita
The Gita again and again emphasises that one should cultivate an attitude of non-attachment
or detachment. It urges repeatedly that an individual should live in the world like water on a lotus
leaf. “He who does actions, offering them to Brahman and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by
sin as a lotus leaf by water”—V.10.
Attachment is due to infatuation. It is the offspring of the quality of Rajas. Detachment is
born of Sattwa.
