He who understands the nature of the body and
human relationships based upon it will not grieve.
Aashcharyavat pashyati kashchid enam
Aashcharyavad vadati tathaiva chaanyah;
Aashcharyavacchainam anyah shrinoti

29. One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It
as a wonder; yet, having heard, none understands It at all.
COMMENTARY: The verse may also be interpreted in this manner: he that sees, hears
and speaks of the Self is a wonderful man. Such a man is very rare. He is one among many
thousands. Therefore, the Self is very hard to understand.
Dehee nityam avadhyo’yam dehe sarvasya bhaarata;
Tasmaat sarvaani bhootaani na twam shochitum arhasi.
30. This, the Indweller in the body of everyone, is always indestructible, O Arjuna!
Therefore, thou shouldst not grieve for any creature.
Swadharmam api chaavekshya na vikampitum arhasi;
Dharmyaaddhi yuddhaacchreyo’nyat kshatriyasya na vidyate.
