Such an individual should be considered a true Jivanmukta.
COMMENTARY: A Jivanmukta is one who has attained liberation while living.
Geetaam aashritya bahavo bhoobhujo janakaadayah;
Nirdhootakalmashaa loke geetaa yaataah param padam.
20. In this world, taking refuge in the Gita, many kings like Janaka and others reached the
highest state or goal, purified of all sins.
Geetaayaah pathanam kritwaa maahaatmyam naiva yah pathet;
Vrithaa paatho bhavet tasya shrama eva hyudaahritah.

BHAGAVAD GITA
21. He who fails to read this “Glory of the Gita” after having read the Gita, loses the benefit
thereby, and the effort alone remains.
COMMENTARY: This is to test and confirm the faith of the reader in the Bhagavad Gita,
which is not a mere philosophical book but the word of God and should therefore be studied with
great faith and devotion. The Gita Mahatmya generates this devotion in one’s heart.
Etanmaahaatmyasamyuktam geetaabhyaasam karoti yah;
Sa tatphalamavaapnoti durlabhaam gatim aapnuyaat.
