Neither by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, nor by gifts, nor by rituals, nor by
severe austerities, can I be seen in this form in the world of men by any other than thyself, O great
hero of the Kurus (Arjuna)!
Maa te vyathaa maa cha vimoodhabhaavo
Drishtwaa roopam ghorameedringmamedam;
Vyapetabheeh preetamanaah punastwam
Tadeva me roopamidam prapashya.

49. Be not afraid nor bewildered on seeing such a terrible form of Mine as this; with thy fear
entirely dispelled and with a gladdened heart, now behold again this former form of Mine.
Sanjaya Uvaacha:
Ityarjunam vaasudevastathoktwaa
Swakam roopam darshayaamaasa bhooyah;
Aashwaasayaamaasa cha bheetamenam
Bhootwaa punah saumyavapurmahaatmaa.
