A busy man with an active temperament will be greatly benefited by the commentary
of Sri Gangadhar Lokamanya Tilak, entitled Gita Rahasya. A man of devotional temperament will
be attracted by Sri Sridhara’s commentary, and a man of reason by that of Sri Shankara.
The Gita is like an ocean. Sri Shankara, Sri Ramanuja and Sri Madhava dived into it and
gave accounts of their interpretation and established their own philosophy. Anyone can do the same
and bring out the most precious pearls of divine knowledge and give their own interpretation. Glory
to the Gita! Glory to the Lord of the Gita!
The teachings of the Gita are broad, universal and sublime. They do not belong to any cult,
sect, creed, age or country. They are meant for the people of the whole world. Based on the
soul-elevating Upanishads—the ancient wisdom of seers and saints—the Gita prescribes methods
which are within the reach of all.
