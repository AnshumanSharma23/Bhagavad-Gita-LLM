endowed with faith, regarding Me as their supreme goal, they, the devotees, are exceedingly dear to
Me.

Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the
scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the twelfth discourse entitled:
“The Yoga of Devotion”
XIII
THE YOGA OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE FIELD & THE
KNOWER OF THE FIELD
Summary of Thirteenth Discourse
In this discourse we have one of the most significant, most illuminating, most inspiring and
most mystical portions of the Bhagavad Gita. The Lord gives us a wonderfully revealing insight
into the human individual. It is the metaphysics of man, the unknown. The immortal Soul, with its
physical embodiment, is the main theme of this discourse.
