Kindly fulfil my desire in this war.”
xvii
The Lord, who is ever the most devoted lover of His devotees, accepted his request with
pleasure; and thus Krishna became the charioteer of Arjuna in the battle of the Mahabharata.
After the return of Duryodhana and Arjuna from Dwaraka, Lord Krishna Himself went once
to Hastinapura as the emissary of the Pandavas and tried to prevent the war. But then, under the
guidance of Sakuni, the egoistic Duryodhana refused to agree to the peace mission and tried to
imprison Lord Krishna, at which Krishna showed His Supreme Form (Viswarupa). Even the blind
Dhritarashtra saw it by the Lord’s Grace.
