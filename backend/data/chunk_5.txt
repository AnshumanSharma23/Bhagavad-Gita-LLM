The Bhagavad Gita contains words of wisdom and practical
teachings that contain the answers to the above-mentioned condition of the present-day individual.
The Bhagavad Gita is a message addressed to each and every human individual to help him
or her to solve the vexing problem of overcoming the present and progressing towards a bright
future. This holy scripture is not just an “old scripture”, nor is it just a book of “religious teachings”,
nor even a Hindu holy book. It transcends the bounds of any particular religion or race, and is
actually divine wisdom addressed to mankind for all times, in order to help human beings face and
solve the ever-present problems of birth and death, of pain, suffering, fear, bondage, love and hate.
It enables man to liberate himself from all limiting factors and reach a state of perfect balance, inner
stability and mental peace, complete freedom from grief, fear and anxiety. Within its eighteen
chapters is revealed a human drama.
