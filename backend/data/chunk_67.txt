He was to
act as the charioteer of Arjuna, one of the Pandava princes.
The din of hundreds of conches, blaring forth suddenly, announced the commencement of
the battle. Arjuna blew his conch “Devadatta”, while Bhima, his brother, sounded the “Paundra”.
All the other great warriors blew their respective conches.
As the two armies were arrayed, ready for battle, Arjuna requested Krishna to place his
chariot between them so that he might survey his opponents. He was bewildered by the scene before
him, for he beheld on both sides, fathers and grandfathers, teachers and uncles, fathers-in-law,
grandsons, relatives and comrades.
Confusion reigned in Arjuna’s mind. Should he participate in this terrible carnage? Was it
proper to destroy one’s relatives for the sake of a kingdom and some pleasures? Would it not be
much better for him to surrender everything in favour of his enemies and retire in peace? As these
thoughts rushed into his mind, a feeling of despondency overtook Arjuna.
