FOREWORD
The modern man in this present decade of the second half of the 20th century is greatly in
need of an effective guide to light. He is groping. He sees only problems everywhere and no
solutions are to be found anywhere. He does not know which way to turn, what course to adopt and
how to move towards a better state of things. Therefore, his life is filled with restlessness,
unhappiness and complication.
