As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker—to such is compared the Yogi of
controlled mind, practising Yoga in the Self (or absorbed in the Yoga of the Self).
COMMENTARY: This is a beautiful simile which Yogis often quote when they talk of
concentration or one-pointedness of mind.
Yatroparamate chittam niruddham yogasevayaa;
Yatra chaivaatmanaa’tmaanam pashyannaatmani tushyati.
20. When the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga, attains to quietude, and when, seeing
the Self by the Self, he is satisfied in his own Self,
Sukhamaatyantikam yattad buddhi graahyamateendriyam;
Vetti yatra na chaivaayam sthitashchalati tattwatah.
21. When he (the Yogi) feels that infinite bliss which can be grasped by the (pure) intellect
and which transcends the senses, and, established wherein he never moves from the Reality,
Yam labdhwaa chaaparam laabham manyate naadhikam tatah;
Yasmin sthito na duhkhena gurunaapi vichaalyate.
