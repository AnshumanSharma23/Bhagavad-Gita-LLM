Ever content, steady in meditation, possessed of firm conviction, self-controlled, with
mind and intellect dedicated to Me, he, My devotee, is dear to Me.
Yasmaannodwijate loko lokaannodwijate cha yah;
Harshaamarshabhayodwegairmukto yah sa cha me priyah.
15. He by whom the world is not agitated and who cannot be agitated by the world, and who
is freed from joy, envy, fear and anxiety—he is dear to Me.
Anapekshah shuchirdaksha udaaseeno gatavyathah;
Sarvaarambhaparityaagee yo madbhaktah sa me priyah.
16. He who is free from wants, pure, expert, unconcerned, and untroubled, renouncing all
undertakings or commencements—he who is (thus) devoted to Me, is dear to Me.
Yona hrishyati na dweshti na shochati na kaangkshati;
Shubhaashubhaparityaagee bhaktimaan yah sa me priyah.
