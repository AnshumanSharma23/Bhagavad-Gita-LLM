Give me easy lessons.
Kindly explain; why did Sukadev, a Brahma Jnani who was always absorbed in Brahman,
teach the Bhagavata to King Parikshit? What are the differences in the experiences of a Bhakta who
enjoys union with God, of a Yogi who is established in the highest Superconscious State, and of a
Jnani firmly established in the state of oneness or Brahman? What is the real difference between

liberation while living and disembodied liberation, between the transcendent state and the state
beyond it, between the perishable Person, the imperishable Person and the Supreme Person?
Let me be frank with Thee, O Krishna, because Thou art the indweller of my heart, the
witness of my mind, and the Lord of my life-breath! I cannot hide anything from Thee, because
Thou directly witnesseth all the thoughts that emanate from my mind. I have no fear of Thee. Thou
art my friend now. Treat me like Arjuna. I shall sing and dance. You can play on the flute. Let us eat
sugar-candy and butter together. Let us sing.
