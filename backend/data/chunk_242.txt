And whatever is the seed of all beings, that also am I, O Arjuna! There is no being,
whether moving or unmoving, that can exist without Me.
COMMENTARY: I am the primeval seed from which all creation has come into existence.
I am the seed of everything. I am the Self of everything. Nothing can exist without Me. Everything
is of My nature. I am the soul of everything.
Naanto’sti mama divyaanaam vibhooteenaam parantapa;
Esha tooddeshatah prokto vibhootervistaro mayaa.
40. There is no end to My divine glories, O Arjuna, but this is a brief statement by Me of the
particulars of My divine glories!
Yadyad vibhootimat sattwam shreemadoorjitameva vaa;
Tattadevaavagaccha twam mama tejom’shasambhavam.
41. Whatever being there is that is glorious, prosperous or powerful, that know thou to be a
manifestation of a part of My splendour.
