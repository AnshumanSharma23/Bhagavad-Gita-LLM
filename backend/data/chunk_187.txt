Prakriti or Nature is made
up of the three Gunas or qualitiesâ€”Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas. These three qualities delude the soul
and make it forget its true nature, which is one with God. This delusion, termed Maya, can only be
removed by the Grace of the Lord Himself.
Thus far Arjuna has been taught the highest form of devotion, which leads to union with
God in His static aspect as also with His dynamic Prakriti. Krishna tells him that there are also other
forms of devotion which are inferior as they are performed with various motives. The distressed,
the seeker of divine wisdom, and he who desires wealth, worship Him, as also the wise. Of these the
Lord deems the wise as dearest to Him. Such a devotee loves the Lord for the sake of pure love
alone. Whatever form the devotee worships, the ultimate goal is the Lord Himself.
