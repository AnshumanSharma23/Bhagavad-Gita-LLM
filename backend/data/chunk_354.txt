He from whom all the beings have evolved and by whom all this is pervaded,
worshipping Him with his own duty, man attains perfection.
COMMENTARY: Man attains perfection by worshipping the Lord through the
performance of his own duty, that is, he becomes qualified for the dawn of Self-knowledge.
Shreyaanswadharmo vigunah paradharmaat swanushthitaat;

performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no sin.

Sarvaarambhaa hi doshena dhoomenaagnirivaavritaah.
48. One should not abandon, O Arjuna, the duty to which one is born, though faulty; for, all

Asaktabuddhih sarvatra jitaatmaa vigatasprihah;
Naishkarmyasiddhim paramaam sannyaasenaadhigacchati.
