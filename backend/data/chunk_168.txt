The aspirant will then
be compelled to carry on his Yogic practices with greater vigour and faith and will finally achieve
God-realisation.
Krishna concludes that the Yogi—one who has attained union with the Supreme Lord—is
superior to the ascetics, to the men of book knowledge and the men of action, as the latter have not
transcended ignorance and merged in the Self.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Anaashritah karmaphalam kaaryam karma karoti yah;
Sa sannyaasi cha yogee cha na niragnirna chaakriyah.
The Blessed Lord said:
1. He who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actions—he is a
Sannyasin and a Yogi, not he who is without fire and without action.
Yam sannyaasamiti praahuryogam tam viddhi paandava;
Na hyasannyastasankalpo yogee bhavati kashchana.
