They, having enjoyed the vast heaven, enter the world of mortals when their merits are
exhausted; thus abiding by the injunctions of the three (Vedas) and desiring (objects of) desires,
they attain to the state of going and returning.
COMMENTARY: When their accumulated merits are exhausted, they come to this world

Teshaam nityaabhiyuktaanaam yogakshemam vahaamyaham.
22. To those men who worship Me alone, thinking of no other, of those ever united, I secure

Ye’pyanyadevataa bhaktaa yajante shraddhayaa’nvitaah;
Te’pi maameva kaunteya yajantyavidhipoorvakam.
23. Even those devotees who, endowed with faith, worship other gods, worship Me only, O
Arjuna, but by the wrong method!
Aham hi sarvayajnaanaam bhoktaa cha prabhureva cha;
Na tu maamabhijaananti tattwenaatashchyavanti te.
