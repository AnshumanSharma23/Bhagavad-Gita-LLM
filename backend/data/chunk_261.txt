Whatever I have presumptuously uttered from love or carelessness, addressing Thee as
O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend! regarding Thee merely as a friend, unknowing of this, Thy
greatness,
Yachchaavahaasaartham asatkrito’si
Vihaarashayyaasanabhojaneshu;
Eko’thavaapyachyuta tatsamaksham
Tatkshaamaye twaamaham aprameyam.
42. In whatever way I may have insulted Thee for the sake of fun while at play, reposing,
sitting or at meals, when alone (with Thee), O Achyuta, or in company—that I implore Thee,
immeasurable one, to forgive!
Pitaasi lokasya charaacharasya
Twamasya poojyashcha gururgareeyaan;
Na twatsamo’styabhyadhikah kuto’nyo
Lokatraye’pyapratimaprabhaava.
43. Thou art the Father of this world, unmoving and moving. Thou art to be adored by this
world.
