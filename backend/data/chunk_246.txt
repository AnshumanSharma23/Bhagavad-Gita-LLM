If Thou, O Lord, thinkest it possible for me to see it, do Thou, then, O Lord of the Yogis,
show me Thy imperishable Self!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Pashya me paartha roopaani shatashoâ€™tha sahasrashah;
Naanaavidhaani divyaani naanaavarnaakriteeni cha.
The Blessed Lord said:
5. Behold, O Arjuna, My forms by the hundreds and thousands, of different sorts, divine and
of various colours and shapes!
Pashyaadityaan vasoon rudraan ashwinau marutastathaa;
Bahoonyadrishtapoorvaani pashyaashcharyaani bhaarata.
6. Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Asvins and also the Maruts; behold
many wonders never seen before, O Arjuna!
Ihaikastham jagatkritsnam pashyaadya sacharaacharam;
Mama dehe gudaakesha yachchaanyad drashtumicchasi.
