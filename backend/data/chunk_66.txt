Salutations to that God whom Brahma, Indra, Varuna, Rudra and the Maruts praise with
divine hymns, of whom the Sama-chanters sing by the Vedas and their Angas (in the Pada and
Krama methods), and by the Upanishads; whom the Yogis see with their minds absorbed in Him
through meditation, and whose ends the hosts of Devas and Asuras know not!

THE YOGA OF THE DESPONDENCY OF ARJUNA
Summary of First Discourse
The great Mahabharata war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas took place on the holy
plain of Kurukshetra. After the failure of Lord Krishnaâ€™s peace mission, when He Himself went to
Hastinapura as the emissary of the Pandavas, there was no other alternative for the Pandavas but to
engage in war for their rightful share of the kingdom.
All the famous warriors from both sides had assembled on the battlefield. Tents and
wagons, weapons and machines, chariots and animals covered the vast plain.
Lord Krishna arrived on the scene in a magnificent chariot yoked by white horses.
