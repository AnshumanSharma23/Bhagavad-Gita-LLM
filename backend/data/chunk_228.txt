They have completely
surrendered to Him and through single-minded devotion they are granted the power of
discrimination, the discrimination that leads them from the unreal to the Real. Krishna emphatically
declares that ignorance is destroyed and knowledge gained through Divine Grace alone.
Arjuna accepts the descent of the Supreme in a human form, but wishes to know from the
Lord Himself His Cosmic powers by means of which He controls the diverse forces of the universe.
The Lord describes His Divine glories, bringing within the range of Arjuna’s comprehension His
limitless manifestations, and how He upholds everything. In short, the Lord is the Almighty Power
that creates, sustains and destroys everything.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Bhooya eva mahaabaaho shrinu me paramam vachah;
Yatte’ham preeyamaanaaya vakshyaami hitakaamyayaa.
