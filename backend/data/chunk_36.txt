Those who disregard the Lord’s commandment: “Renouncing all actions in Me, with the
mind centred in the Self free from hope and egoism and from mental fever, do thou fight”, and who
sit quiet, renouncing their own duty, will not derive any benefit by such renunciation. The power of
Maya is invincible to even wise men; then how much more difficult it would be for worldly men to
conquer it! For them, renunciation of work without attainment of knowledge is undesirable. They
will be caught in the clutches of Maya. Of what avail is their effort to control the senses, or what can
restraint do in their case? These worldly men cannot escape the clutches of likes and dislikes.
Even the residual good tendencies in the wise men work in accordance with the qualities of
their nature, namely, Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas. The wise too are affected by the three Gunas when
they are not actually in the state of Samadhi.
