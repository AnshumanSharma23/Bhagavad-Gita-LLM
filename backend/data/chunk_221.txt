(As the sun) I give heat; I withhold and send forth the rain; I am immortality and also
death, existence and non-existence, O Arjuna!
Traividyaa maam somapaah pootapaapaa
Yajnairishtwaa swargatim praarthayante;
Te punyamaasaadya surendraloka-
Mashnanti divyaan divi devabhogaan.
20. The knowers of the three Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, purified of all sins, worshipping
Me by sacrifices, pray for the way to heaven; they reach the holy world of the Lord of the gods and
enjoy in heaven the divine pleasures of the gods.

THE YOGA OF THE KINGLY SCIENCE & THE KINGLY SECRET
Te tam bhuktwaa swargalokam vishaalam
Ksheene punye martyalokam vishanti;
Evam trayeedharmamanuprapannaa
Gataagatam kaamakaamaa labhante.
