Upon the second reading he should adopt the method of
selectivity, not in reading but in what he takes from it. Such things as seem to be particularly Hindu
and therefore, perhaps, not acceptable to him as a person of another faith, he can just pass by
without being perturbed. But everything else that is of a purely philosophical, psychological,
ethical and psychical nature,â€”all these he can grasp and assimilate fully. He will be wonderfully
enriched and supremely blessed. His life will become new from that moment. All clouds will
vanish. Light will fill the heart and mind. I assure him of this. This is the Gita.
I commend this wonderful gift of God unto every man and woman, towards his or her
supreme blessedness and highest welfare.
