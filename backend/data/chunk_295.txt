Purity, passion and inertiaâ€”these qualities, O mighty-armed Arjuna, born of Nature,
bind fast in the body, the embodied, the indestructible!
COMMENTARY: The three Gunas are present in all human beings. None is free from the
operation of any one of the three qualities. They are not constant. Sometimes Sattwa predominates
and at other times Rajas or Tamas predominates. One should analyse and stand as a witness of these
three qualities.
Tatra sattwam nirmalatwaat prakaashakam anaamayam;
Sukhasangena badhnaati jnaanasangena chaanagha.
6. Of these, Sattwa, which from its stainlessness is luminous and healthy, binds by
attachment to knowledge and to happiness, O sinless one!
Rajo raagaatmakam viddhi trishnaasangasamudbhavam;
Tannibadhnaati kaunteya karmasangena dehinam.
