There is nothing more to be attained beyond this.
Just as the dark unfathomed depths of the ocean contain most precious pearls, so also the
Bhagavad Gita contains spiritual gems of incalculable value. You will have to dive deep into its
depths with a sincere attitude of reverence and faith. Only then will you be able to collect its
spiritual pearls and comprehend its infinitely profound and subtle teachings.
The Bhagavad Gita is a unique book for all ages. It is one of the most authoritative books of
the Hindu religion. It is the immortal song of the Soul, which bespeaks of the glory of life. The
instructions given by Sri Krishna are for the whole world. It is a standard book on Yoga for all
mankind. The language is as simple as could be. Even a man who has an elementary knowledge of
Sanskrit can go through the book.
There are numerous commentaries on the Gita at the present time. A volume can be written
on each verse.
