Show me that (previous) form only, O God! Have mercy, O God of gods! O
abode of the universe!
Kireetinam gadinam chakrahastam
Icchaami twaam drashtumaham tathaiva;
Tenaiva roopena chaturbhujena
Sahasrabaaho bhava vishwamoorte.
46. I desire to see Thee as before, crowned, bearing a mace, with the discus in hand, in Thy
former form only, having four arms, O thousand-armed, Cosmic Form (Being)!
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Mayaa prasannena tavaarjunedam
Roopam param darshitamaatmayogaat;
Tejomayam vishwamanantamaadyam
Yanme twadanyena na drishtapoorvam.
The Blessed Lord said:
47. O Arjuna, this Cosmic Form has graciously been shown to thee by Me by My own Yogic
power; full of splendour, primeval, and infinite, this Cosmic Form of Mine has never been seen
before by anyone other than thyself.
Na vedayajnaadhyayanairna daanair
Na cha kriyaabhirna tapobhirugraih;
Evam roopah shakya aham nriloke
Drashtum twadanyena karupraveera.
48.
