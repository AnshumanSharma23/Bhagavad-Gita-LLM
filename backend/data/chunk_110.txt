In that peace all pains are destroyed, for the intellect of the tranquil-minded soon
becomes steady.
COMMENTARY: When peace is attained all miseries end.
Naasti buddhir ayuktasya na chaayuktasya bhaavanaa;
Na chaabhaavayatah shaantir ashaantasya kutah sukham.
66. There is no knowledge of the Self to the unsteady, and to the unsteady no meditation is
possible; and to the un-meditative there can be no peace; and to the man who has no peace, how can
there be happiness?
Indriyaanaam hi charataam yanmanoâ€™nuvidheeyate;
Tadasya harati prajnaam vaayur naavam ivaambhasi.
67. For the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his
discrimination as the wind (carries away) a boat on the waters.
