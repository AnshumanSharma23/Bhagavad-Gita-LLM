Duryodhana, however, flatly refused to part with as much
land as could be covered by the point of a needle. According to the advice of Mother Kunti and with
the inspiration of Lord Krishna, the Pandavas decided upon war and tried to establish their rightful
claim on the kingdom by overcoming the Kauravas.
Duryodhana and Arjuna, from the side of the Kauravas and Pandavas respectively, were
sent to Dwaraka to seek the help of the Yadava hero, Lord Krishna, in the battle. They both found
Krishna resting on a couch in His palace. Duryodhana went in and occupied a seat at the head of the
couch while Arjuna stood near the feet of the Lord. The moment Sri Krishna opened His eyes, He
naturally saw Arjuna first, and then Duryodhana sitting on a chair. After enquiry of their welfare
and the purpose of their visit, Sri Krishna, according to the prevailing custom, gave the first choice
to Arjuna, because of his age, and also because of His sight of Arjuna first.
