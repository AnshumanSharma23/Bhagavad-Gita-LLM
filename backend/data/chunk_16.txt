Ignorance is Dhritarashtra; the individual soul is Arjuna; the
indweller of your heart is Lord Krishna, the charioteer; the body is the chariot; the senses are the
five horses; mind, egoism, mental impressions, senses, cravings, likes and dislikes, lust, jealousy,
greed, pride and hypocrisy are your dire enemies.
Guide For Study
As the Gita contains subtle and profound teachings, you should study it under a qualified
teacher, one who is established in the Absolute. Only when studied with great and intense faith,
single-minded devotion and purity, will the truths contained therein be revealed unto you like a fruit
on the palm of your hand. Good commentaries written by realised sages will also be of immense
help to you.
Worldly-minded individuals, however intellectual they may be, cannot grasp the essential
teachings of the Gita. They enter into unnecessary discussions and useless debates. They cavil and
carp at the teachings.
