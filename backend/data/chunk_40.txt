Study of the Gita must be made compulsory in all schools and colleges of India; nay, of the
whole world. It must become a textbook for students of schools and colleges. It should find a very

sensible and perfect.
Hold the magnificent torch of faith. Float high the unique banner of peace. Wear the
magnificent shield of dispassion. Put on the marvellous coat of arms of discrimination. Sing the
immortal song of Soham, Shivoham, Radheshyam or Sitaram. March boldly with the band of
Pranava. Blow the conch of courage.
