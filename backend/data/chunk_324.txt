Arjuna asks, “What about those who, even though setting aside scriptural
injunctions yet perform worship with faith?”
The Lord replies and states that the faith of such men who ignore the injunctions of the
scriptures could be either Sattwic, Rajasic or Tamasic. This would be in accordance with the basic
nature of the person himself. And, conversely, as is the kind of faith, so develops the nature of the
man.
Thus, in all things like sacrifice, worship, charity, penance, etc., these qualities become
expressed in accordance with the kind of faith in which the person concerned is based. They
produce results in accordance with the quality of the doer’s faith. These acts done with right faith
lead to supreme blessedness. When done without any faith whatsoever, all these actions become
barren and useless.
