Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, O Lord of the Earth, and the son of Subhadra, the
mighty-armed, all blew their respective conches!
Sa ghosho dhaartaraashtraanaam hridayaani vyadaarayat;
Nabhashcha prithiveem chaiva tumulo vyanunaadayan.
19. The tumultuous sound rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra’s party, making both heaven and
earth resound.
Atha vyavasthitaan drishtwaa dhaartaraashtraan kapidhwajah;
Pravritte shastrasampaate dhanurudyamya paandavah.
Hrisheekesham tadaa vaakyamidamaaha maheepate;
20. Then, seeing all the people of Dhritarashtra’s party standing arrayed and the discharge
of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, whose ensign was that of a monkey, took up
his bow and said the following to Krishna, O Lord of the Earth!
Arjuna Uvaacha:
Senayor ubhayormadhye ratham sthaapaya me’chyuta.
Yaavad etaan nireekshe’ham yoddhukaamaan avasthitaan;
Kair mayaa saha yoddhavyam asmin ranasamudyame.
Arjuna said:
21-22.
