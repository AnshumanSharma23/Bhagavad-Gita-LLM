without thee, none of the warriors arrayed in the hostile armies shall live.

Jitwaa shatroon bhungkshwa raajyam samriddham;
Mayaivaite nihataah poorvameva
Nimittamaatram bhava savyasaachin.

Dronam cha bheeshmam cha jayadratham cha
Karnam tathaaâ€™nyaanapi yodhaveeraan;
Mayaa hataamstwam jahi maa vyathishthaa
Yudhyaswa jetaasi rane sapatnaan.
