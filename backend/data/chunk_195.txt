The foolish think of Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My
higher, immutable and most excellent nature.
Naaham prakaashah sarvasya yogamaayaasamaavritah;
Moodhoâ€™yam naabhijaanaati loko maamajamavyayam.
25. I am not manifest to all (as I am), being veiled by the Yoga Maya. This deluded world
does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable.
Vedaaham samateetaani vartamaanaani chaarjuna;
Bhavishyaani cha bhootani maam tu veda na kashchana.
26. I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, the present and the future, but no one knows
Me.
Icchaadweshasamutthena dwandwamohena bhaarata;
Sarvabhootaani sammoham sarge yaanti parantapa.
27. By the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O Bharata, all
beings are subject to delusion at birth, O Parantapa!
Yeshaam twantagatam paapam janaanaam punyakarmanaam;
Te dwandwamohanirmuktaa bhajante maam dridhavrataah.
28.
