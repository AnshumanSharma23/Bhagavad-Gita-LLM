What are the marks of him who has crossed over the three qualities, O Lord? What is his
conduct and how does he go beyond these three qualities?
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Prakaasham cha pravrittim cha mohameva cha paandava;
Na dweshti sampravrittaani na nivrittaani kaangkshati.
The Blessed Lord said:
22. Light, activity and delusion,—when they are present, O Arjuna, he hates not, nor does
he long for them when they are absent!
Udaaseenavadaaseeno gunairyo na vichaalyate;
Gunaa vartanta ityeva yo’vatishthati nengate.
23. He who, seated like one unconcerned, is not moved by the qualities, and who, knowing
that the qualities are active, is self-centred and moves not,
Samaduhkhasukhah swasthah samaloshtaashmakaanchanah;
Tulyapriyaapriyo dheeras tulyanindaatma samstutih.
