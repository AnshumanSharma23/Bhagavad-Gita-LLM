But he who knows the truth, O mighty-armed Arjuna, about the divisions of the qualities
and their functions, knowing that the Gunas as senses move amidst the Gunas as the sense-objects,
is not attached.
Prakriter gunasammoodhaah sajjante gunakarmasu;
Taan akritsnavido mandaan kritsnavin na vichaalayet.
29. Those deluded by the qualities of Nature are attached to the functions of the qualities. A
man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one of imperfect knowledge.
Mayi sarvaani karmaani sannyasyaadhyaatma chetasaa;
Niraasheer nirmamo bhootwaa yudhyaswa vigatajwarah.
30. Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centred in the Self, free from hope and
egoism, and from (mental) fever, do thou fight.
COMMENTARY: Surrender all actions to Me with the thought: “I perform all actions for
the sake of the Lord only.”
Ye me matam idam nityam anutishthanti maanavaah;
Shraddhaavanto’nasooyanto muchyante te’pi karmabhih.
