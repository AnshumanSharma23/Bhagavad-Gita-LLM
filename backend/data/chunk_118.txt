Verily none can ever remain for even a moment without performing action; for, everyone
is made to act helplessly indeed by the qualities born of Nature.
COMMENTARY: The ignorant man is driven to action helplessly by the actions of the
Gunas—Rajas, Tamas and Sattwa.
Karmendriyaani samyamya ya aaste manasaa smaran;
Indriyaarthaan vimoodhaatmaa mithyaachaarah sa uchyate.
6. He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in mind, he, of
deluded understanding, is called a hypocrite.
Yastwindriyaani manasaa niyamyaarabhate’rjuna;
Karmendriyaih karmayogam asaktah sa vishishyate.
7. But whosoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma
Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels!

Niyatam kuru karma twam karma jyaayo hyakarmanah;
Shareerayaatraapi cha te na prasiddhyed akarmanah.
