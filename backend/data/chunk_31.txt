Discipline and purification of the mind and the senses are the prerequisites for
aspirants on the path of God-realisation.
Even when the nature of God is explained, those who have not been purged of their faults
and impurities would either disbelieve or misbelieve it, as was the case with Indra and Virochana.
Therefore, knowledge as inculcated arises only in him who has purified himself by austerity,
performed either in this or in a previous birth.
The Upanishads declare: “To that high-souled man whose devotion to his preceptor is as
great as that to the Lord, the secrets explained here become illumined”.
Some people catch fish in the Ganges river to satisfy their palate. Then they quote the Gita
in support of their evil actions: “Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It
not”—II.23. Wonderful philosophy indeed! Devils can also quote scriptures. These people are the
followers of the Virochana school. They are evil-doing, deluded and the vilest of men.
