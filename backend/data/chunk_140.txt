The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and
Karma; though I am the author thereof, know Me as the non-doer and immutable.
COMMENTARY: The four castes are Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya and Sudra. This
division is according to the Guna and Karma. Guna is quality. Karma is the kind of work. Both
Guna and Karma determine the caste of a man.
In a Brahmana, Sattwa predominates. He possesses serenity, purity, self-restraint,
straightforwardness and devotion.
In a Kshatriya, Rajas predominates. He possesses prowess, splendour, firmness, dexterity,
generosity and rulership.
In a Vaisya, Rajas predominates and Tamas is subordinate to Rajas. He does the duty of
ploughing, protection of cattle and trade.
In a Sudra, Tamas predominates and Rajas is subordinate to the quality of Tamas. He
renders service to the other three castes.
