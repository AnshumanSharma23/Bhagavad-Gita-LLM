Do thou perform thy bounden duty, for action is superior to inaction and even the
maintenance of the body would not be possible for thee by inaction.
Yajnaarthaat karmano’nyatra loko’yam karmabandhanah;
Tadartham karma kaunteya muktasangah samaachara.
9. The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice; do
thou, therefore, O son of Kunti, perform action for that sake (for sacrifice) alone, free from
attachment!
COMMENTARY: If anyone does actions for the sake of the Lord, he is not bound. His
heart is purified by performing actions for the sake of the Lord. Where this spirit of unselfishness
does not govern the action, such actions bind one to worldliness, however good or glorious they
may be.
Sahayajnaah prajaah srishtwaa purovaacha prajaapatih;
Anena prasavishyadhwam esha vo’stvishtakaamadhuk.
