It is a
universal scripture applicable to people of all temperaments and for all times. It is a wonderful book
with sublime thoughts and practical instructions on Yoga, devotion, Vedanta and action. It is a
marvellous book, profound in thought and sublime in heights of vision. It brings peace and solace to
souls that are afflicted by the three fires of mortal existence, namely, afflictions caused by one’s
own body, those caused by beings around one, and those caused by the gods.
The Gita contains the divine nectar. It is the wish-fulfilling gem, tree and cow. You can milk
anything from it. It is a book for eternity. It is not a catch-penny book, with life like that of a
mushroom. It can be one’s constant companion of life. It is a vade-mecum for all. Peace, bliss,
wisdom, Brahman, Nirvana, Param Padam and Gita are all synonymous terms.
The Gita is a boundless ocean of nectar. It is the immortal celestial fruit of the Upanishadic
tree.
