He should fix his purified mind on the Atman by concentrating between the
eyebrows or on the tip of the nose.
The practice of Brahmacharya is absolutely necessary if one is to succeed in meditation.
The conservation and transformation of the vital fluid into spiritual energy gives immense power of
concentration. Fearlessness, too, is an essential quality on the Godward path. It is faith in the
sustaining protection and Grace of God.
The aspirant is advised to practise moderation in his daily habitsâ€”in eating, sleeping,
recreation, etc. Extremes are to be avoided as they hinder the practice of meditation. Living a life of
such moderation, and gathering up all his forces and directing them towards meditation upon the
Atman, the aspirant gradually transcends the senses and intellect and merges himself in the blissful
Atman. He finds that the bliss of the Atman is incomparable, that there is no gain greater than the
Self.
