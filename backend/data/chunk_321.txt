Triple is the gate of this hell, destructive of the self—lust, anger, and greed,—therefore,
one should abandon these three.
Etairvimuktah kaunteya tamodwaaraistribhirnarah;
Aacharatyaatmanah shreyas tato yaati paraam gatim.
22. A man who is liberated from these three gates to darkness, O Arjuna, practises what is
good for him and thus goes to the Supreme goal!
COMMENTARY: When these three gates to hell are abandoned, the path to salvation is
cleared for the aspirant. He gets the company of sages, which leads to liberation. He receives
spiritual instructions and practises them. He hears the scriptures, reflects, meditates and attains
Self-realisation.
Yah shaastravidhimutsrijya vartate kaamakaaratah;
Na sa siddhimavaapnoti na sukham na paraam gatim.
