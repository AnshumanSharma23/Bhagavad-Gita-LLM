Those whose wisdom has been rent away by this or that desire, go to other gods,
following this or that rite, led by their own nature.
Yo yo yaam yaam tanum bhaktah shraddhayaarchitum icchati;
Tasya tasyaachalaam shraddhaam taameva vidadhaamyaham.
21. Whatsoever form any devotee desires to worship with faithâ€”that (same) faith of his I
make firm and unflinching.
Sa tayaa shraddhayaa yuktastasyaaraadhanameehate;
Labhate cha tatah kaamaan mayaiva vihitaan hi taan.
22. Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that (form), and from it he obtains
his desire, these being verily ordained by Me (alone).

BHAGAVAD GITA
Antavattu phalam teshaam tadbhavatyalpamedhasaam;
Devaan devayajo yaanti madbhaktaa yaanti maamapi.
23. Verily the reward (fruit) that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The
worshippers of the gods go to them, but My devotees come to Me.
Avyaktam vyaktimaapannam manyante maamabuddhayah;
Param bhaavamajaananto mamaavyayamanuttamam.
