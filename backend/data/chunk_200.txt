Worship, prayer and offering to the gods with faith and devotion constitute actions that
lead to blessedness.
The secret of reaching the Divine Being and thus freeing oneself forever from birth and
death and the pains and sufferings of this earth-life, is to constantly practise unbroken remembrance
of the Lord at all times, in all places and even amidst oneâ€™s daily activities. If one practises such
steady remembrance through regular daily Sadhana, then he will be rooted in His remembrance
even at the time of departing from this body at death. Thus departing, he will go beyond darkness
and bondage and attain the realm of eternal blessedness.
One must practise sense-control. The senses must be well disciplined and gradually
withdrawn from outside objects. The mind should be centred within upon God, by uttering Om or
any Divine Name.
