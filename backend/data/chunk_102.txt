The Vedas deal with the three attributes (of Nature); be thou above these three attributes,
O Arjuna! Free yourself from the pairs of opposites and ever remain in the quality of Sattwa
(goodness), freed from the thought of acquisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.
COMMENTARY: Guna means attribute or quality. It is substance as well as quality.
Nature is made up of three Gunasâ€”Sattwa (purity, light, harmony), Rajas (passion, restlessness,
motion), and Tamas (inertia, darkness). The pairs of opposites are pleasure and pain, heat and cold,
gain and loss, victory and defeat, honour and dishonour, praise and censure.
Yaavaanartha udapaane sarvatah samplutodake;
Taavaan sarveshu vedeshu braahmanasya vijaanatah.
46. To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a
reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood.
COMMENTARY: Only for a sage who has realised the Self are the Vedas of no use,
because he is in possession of knowledge of the Self.
