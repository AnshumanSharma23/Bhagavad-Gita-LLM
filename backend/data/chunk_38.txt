One’s duty
should in no case be ignored. The Lord, the inner ruler, is the director of the individual soul. As long
as one is not free from ignorance, one is bound to one’s duty. Arjuna’s duty as a Kshatriya was to
fight; and Lord Krishna wanted him to do just that. The Lord has also said that “one’s own duty is
good”.
Yet another critic says: “In XV.7, the Lord says: ‘An eternal portion of Myself, having
become a living soul in the world of life, draws to itself the five senses with the mind for the sixth,
abiding in Nature’. It is quite clear that the individual soul is a part of Brahman, the Absolute. How
can we say that it is identical with Brahman? The doctrine of Advaita is therefore wrong”.
In VII.17, the Lord says: “Of them, the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels;
for I am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me”. Here He speaks of identity. The doctrine
of non-dualism is quite correct. Non-dualism is the highest realisation.
