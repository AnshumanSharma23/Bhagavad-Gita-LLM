When a man sees the whole variety of beings as resting in the One, and spreading forth
from That alone, he then becomes Brahman.
COMMENTARY: A man attains to unity with the Supreme when he knows or realises
through intuition that all these manifold forms are rooted in the One. Like waves in water, like rays
in the sun, so also all forms are rooted in the One.
Anaaditwaan nirgunatwaat paramaatmaayam avyayah;
Shareerasthoâ€™pi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate.
32. Being without beginning and devoid of (any) qualities, the Supreme Self, imperishable,
though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted!
Yathaa sarvagatam saukshmyaadaakaasham nopalipyate;
Sarvatraavasthito dehe tathaatmaa nopalipyate.
