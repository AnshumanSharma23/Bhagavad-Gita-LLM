The supreme transcendental Spirit,
which is the eternal substratum beyond both, is also described in a wonderful manner. The knower
of the Supreme Reality is instantly liberated.
The blessed Lord tells us that the knowledge of the Field and the Knower of the Field is the
true knowledge. This highest and the best knowledge grants us divine wisdom and spiritual
illumination that lead to divine beatitude. This body is the Field. The Immortal Soul (yourself),
dwelling in the body is the Knower of the Field. Verily, it is the Supreme Being who has projected
Himself and assumed the form of this Knower of the Field within this body. This self is none other
than That. Thus, Lord Krishna explains the mystery of the individual soul dwelling within this
mortal body. This knowledge constitutes the main subject matter of all the scriptures and the
highest philosophical works.
The five elements, the ego, the mind, intellect and the ten organs, desire and aversion and
such factors constitute the Field.
