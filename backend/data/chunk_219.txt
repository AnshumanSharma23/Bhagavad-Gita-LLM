But the great souls, O Arjuna, partaking of My divine nature, worship Me with a single
mind (with the mind devoted to nothing else), knowing Me as the imperishable source of beings!

BHAGAVAD GITA
Satatam keertayanto maam yatantashcha dridhavrataah;
Namasyantashcha maam bhaktyaa nityayuktaa upaasate.
14. Always glorifying Me, striving, firm in vows, prostrating before Me, they worship Me
with devotion, ever steadfast.
Jnaanayajnena chaapyanye yajanto maamupaasate;
Ekatwena prithaktwena bahudhaa vishwatomukham.
15. Others also, sacrificing with the wisdom-sacrifice, worship Me, the all-faced, as one, as
distinct, and as manifold.
Aham kraturaham yajnah swadhaa’hamahamaushadham;
Mantro’hamahamevaajyam ahamagniraham hutam.
