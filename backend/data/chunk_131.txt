Thus, knowing Him who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self,
slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to conquer!
COMMENTARY: Restrain the lower self by the higher Self. Subdue the lower mind by
the higher mind. It is difficult to conquer desire because it is of a highly complex and
incomprehensible nature. But a man of discrimination and dispassion, who does constant and
intense Sadhana, can conquer it quite easily.
