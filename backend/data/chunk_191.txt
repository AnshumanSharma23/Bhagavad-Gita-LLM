Know Me, O Arjuna, as the eternal seed of all beings; I am the intelligence of the
intelligent; the splendour of the splendid objects am I!
Balam balavataam asmi kaamaraagavivarjitam;
Dharmaaviruddho bhooteshu kaamoâ€™smi bharatarshabha.
11. Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment, and in (all) beings, I am
the desire unopposed to Dharma, O Arjuna!
Ye chaiva saattvikaa bhaavaa raajasaastaamasaashcha ye;
Matta eveti taanviddhi na twaham teshu te mayi.
12. Whatever being (and objects) that are pure, active and inert, know that they proceed
from Me. They are in Me, yet I am not in them.
Tribhirgunamayair bhaavairebhih sarvamidam jagat;
Mohitam naabhijaanaati maamebhyah paramavyayam.
13. Deluded by these Natures (states or things) composed of the three qualities of Nature, all
this world does not know Me as distinct from them and immutable.
Daivee hyeshaa gunamayee mama maayaa duratyayaa;
Maameva ye prapadyante maayaametaam taranti te.
