Such
a union can only be achieved when one is free from attachment, fear and anger, being thoroughly
purified by right knowledge. The Lord accepts the devotion of all, whatever path they may use to
approach Him.
Various kinds of sacrifices are performed by those engaged in the path to God. Through the
practice of these sacrifices the mind is purified and led Godward. Here also there must be the spirit
of non-attachment to the fruits of actions.
Divine wisdom, according to Sri Krishna, should be sought at the feet of a liberated Guru,
one who has realised the Truth. The aspirant should approach such a sage in a spirit of humility and
devotion. God Himself manifests in the heart of the Guru and instructs the disciple. Having
understood the Truth from the Guru by direct intuitive experience the aspirant is no longer deluded
by ignorance.
The liberated aspirant directly beholds the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self.
