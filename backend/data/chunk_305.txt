He is the resplendent Person who is beyond both this perishable
phenomenal creation as well as the imperishable individual soul which is a part of His eternal
essence. Thus, because He is beyond perishable matter and superior to the imperishable soul
(enveloped in Maya), He is known in this world as well as in the Vedas as the Supreme Person.
Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:
Oordhwamoolam adhahshaakham ashwattham praahuravyayam;
Cchandaamsi yasya parnaani yastam veda sa vedavit.
The Blessed Lord said:
1. They (the wise) speak of the indestructible peepul tree, having its root above and
branches below, whose leaves are the metres or hymns; he who knows it is a knower of the Vedas.
Adhashchordhwam prasritaastasya shaakhaah
Gunapravriddhaa vishayapravaalaah;
Adhashcha moolaanyanusantataani
Karmaanubandheeni manushyaloke.
