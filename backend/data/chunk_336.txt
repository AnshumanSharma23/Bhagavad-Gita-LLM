It covers in brief numerous
important points dealt with in the previous discourses. Here you behold the ultimate result or effect
of the Lord’s discourse to Arjuna. The drama of Arjuna’s utter despondency and breakdown is
finally resolved in triumphant self-mastery, strength and bold resoluteness. Its central message
emerges as an assurance that in and through the performance of one’s respective duties in life one
can qualify for the highest liberation, if one performs actions by renouncing egoism and attachment
and surrendering all desire for selfish, personal gain. By regarding the performance of your duties
as worship offered to God, you obtain the Grace of the Lord and attain the eternal One.
Significantly, this discourse opens with a question by Arjuna asking what is true Sannyasa
and true Tyaga (renunciation).
