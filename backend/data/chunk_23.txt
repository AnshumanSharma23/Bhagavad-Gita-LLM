This is the keynote of the Gita.
The Two Ways
The seers of the Upanishads emphatically declare that the real man is the all-pervading,
immortal Soul which is the substratum of this body, mind and world, which is behind the five
sheaths, namely, the food, vital, mental, intellectual and bliss sheaths.
The goal of life is to directly cognise or realise this self-luminous Self which is hidden in
this body as fire is hidden in wood or as butter in milk. This Self is the inner ruler, the unseen
governor or hidden proprietor of this house, the body.
Real religion is the attainment of this transcendental, supreme, undying, undecaying
Essence through constant and intense meditation. Real life is life in the eternal Soul.
